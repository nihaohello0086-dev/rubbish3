Issues: (c) missing the no-B case; correct is P(X≤4)=p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1−p^4+p^{40}. (d) The approximation is not valid; the correct result is P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40})."
0036,Q3AAAA (6).txt,True,100.0,,1.0,Answered all parts (a)-(d) with required expressions in p.,1.0,Correct binomial modeling and handling of first-success time with X=0 case.,1.0,All expressions match the correct results.,1.0,Combinatorial terms and exponents are correct; sums and complements handled properly.,1.0,Probabilities given appropriately; no unit issues.,"Excellent work. Your binomial probabilities in (a) and (b) are correct. In (c), you correctly accounted for the overlap with X=0 to get 1 − p^4 + p^40. In (d), the conditional probability is derived correctly with the right numerator [C(40,25) − C(36,21)] p^25 (1−p)^15 and denominator 1 − p^4 + p^40."
