[0001] Q3A (1).docx
  overall=100.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)-(d) answered with expressions in p.
    - Method: 1.0
      Correct binomial/geometric reasoning and conditioning; handles X=0 properly.
    - Final Answer: 1.0
      Final expressions are correct and equivalent to standard forms.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Combinatorial/algebraic steps are accurate; identities like C(40,25)=C(40,15) used correctly.
    - Unit: 1.0
      All results are valid probabilities.
  Feedback:
    Excellent work: all parts are correct. Notably, P(X≤4)=1−p^4+p^{40} matches q(1+p+p^2+p^3)+p^{40}, and (d) correctly subtracts the “first 4 are A” cases with E.

[0002] Q3A (2).docx
  overall=60.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts answered, but (c) omitted X=0 case and (d) did not compute the required intersection.
    - Method: 0.0
      Correct binomial setup in (a),(b), but (c) ignores X=0 and (d) uses an unjustified approximation instead of correct conditioning.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) missing +p^{40}; (d) incorrect—both numerator and denominator.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/simplification errors in provided expressions.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately.
  Feedback:
    Good use of binomial formulas in (a) and (b). For (c), include the case X=0: P(X≤4)=p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3)=p^{40}+1−p^4. For (d), you must condition on the position of the first B: P(E∩{X≤4})=p^{25}q^{15}[C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14)]=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)], and P(X≤4)=p^{40}+1−p^4, so P(E|X≤4)=[p^{25}q^{15}(C(40,15)−C(36,15))]/[p^{40}+1−p^4]. Avoid approximations here.

[0003] Q3A (3).docx
  overall=30.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all parts (a)–(d).
    - Method: 0.0
      Missed binomial coefficients in (a),(b); omitted X=0 case in (c); assumed independence for (d) and used product instead of conditional ratio.
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts incorrect as written: (a),(b) lack C(40,k); (c) missing p^40 term; (d) not a conditional probability and uses wrong P(X≤4).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic errors; issues are conceptual/structural.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Key fixes: let q=1−p. (a) Include coefficient: C(40,30) q^30 p^10. (b) Sum k=30..40: ∑ C(40,k) q^k p^{40−k}. (c) P(X≤4)=p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3). (d) P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] / [p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3)]; do not multiply P(E) by P(X≤4).

[0004] Q3A (4).docx
  overall=80.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all parts (a)–(d) with expressions in p.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial modeling in (a),(b). In (c) misused complement (X≤4 is not 1−p^4; must include X=0). In (d) conditioned on ‘at least one B in first 4’ instead of X≤4.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct. (c) missing +p^40 term. (d) denominator should be P(X≤4), not 1−p^4.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Combinatorial factors and exponents are correct; algebraic manipulations consistent.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities given; no units needed.
  Feedback:
    Good on (a),(b). For (c), X≤4 includes X=0; correct is P(X≤4)=p^40+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1−p^4+p^40. For (d), your numerator is fine, but use P(X≤4) in the denominator: P(E|X≤4) = [p^25(1−p)^15 (C(40,25)−C(36,21))] / [p^40+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)]. Avoid ignoring X=0.

  overall=40.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Attempted all parts (a)–(d).
    - Method: 0.0
      Did not apply binomial/geometric models or proper conditioning.
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts incorrect; expressions are not the correct probabilities.
    - Arithmetic: 0.0
      Misuse of coefficients and no correct computations.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities (dimensionless) — no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Use q = 1 − p. (a) Binomial: P = C(40,30) q^30 p^10. (b) P = ∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^k p^{40−k}. (c) First B by time 4 (or none): P = p^{40} + q(1 + p + p^2 + p^3). (d) Condition on X = i, i = 1..4: numerator = p^{25} q^{15}[C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14)], then divide by result from (c).

[0006] Q3A (6).docx
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) omits X=0 case and (d) ignores conditioning.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial approach correct for (a),(b); geometric idea for (c) missing boundary; (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) missing p^40 term; (d) should be conditional, not P(E).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/algebraic errors in the provided expressions.
    - Unit: 1.0
      No units required; expressions are dimensionless probabilities.
  Feedback:
    Good use of binomial probabilities in (a) and (b). For (c), include the case of no B votes: P(X≤4)=p^40+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3). For (d), E is not independent of X≤4; the correct conditional is P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)]/[p^{40}+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0007] Q3A (7).docx
  overall=60.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) omits the X=0 case.
    - Method: 0.0
      Correct binomial setup for (a),(b); (c) misses the no-B scenario; (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c),(d) incorrect.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Algebraic manipulations are consistent with the chosen (though incomplete) setups.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed correctly; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). For (c), include the case X=0 (no one votes B): P(X≤4) = p^40 + (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3) = p^40 + 1 − p^4. For (d), E is not independent of X≤4. The correct expression is P(E|X≤4) = [p^25(1−p)^15 (C(40,15) − C(36,15))] / [p^40 + (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0008] Q3A (8).docx
  overall=50.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)-(d) attempted.
    - Method: 0.0
      Misassigned success probability for B in (a),(b); incorrect treatment of X in (c); ignored conditioning in (d).
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts yield incorrect expressions.
    - Arithmetic: 0.5
      No computation errors, but (c) omits the +p^40 term and (a),(b) exponents correspond to the wrong event.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately.
  Feedback:
    Key issue: B’s probability is 1−p. Corrections: (a) C(40,30)(1−p)^30 p^10. (b) ∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1−p)^k p^{40−k}. (c) P(X≤4)=p^{40}+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3) = p^{40}+(1−p)(1−p^4)/(1−p). (d) Conditioning matters: P(E|X≤4)= p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] / [p^{40}+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0009] Q3A (9).docx
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      (c) ignores X=1,2,3 and X=0 cases; (d) ignores conditioning on X ≤ 4.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial setup correct for (a),(b). For (c), treated only P(X=4). For (d), used unconditional instead of conditional probability.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) and (d) incorrect as stated.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Expressions are algebraically consistent where applicable.
    - Unit: 1.0
      No units required; none misused.
  Feedback:
    (a) Correct. (b) Correct. (c) Need P(X≤4)=p^{40}+(1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3), not just p^3(1-p). (d) Must condition: P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] / [p^{40}+(1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0010] Q3A (10).docx
  overall=80.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all four parts.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial/complement reasoning in (a)-(c); in (d) conditional probability used but omitted the intersection P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}).
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      Parts (a)-(c) correct; (d) incorrect—numerator should account for first B in first 4 (e.g., include [C(40,15) − C(36,15)] factor).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/algebra mistakes; (c) simplification to 1 − p^4 + p^40 is correct.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed correctly; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a)-(c). For (d), use P(E | X ≤ 4) = P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) / P(X ≤ 4). The numerator is not C(40,25)p^25(1−p)^15; it should be p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14)] = p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)]. Denominator P(X ≤ 4) = 1 − p^4 + p^{40} is fine.

[0011] Q3AA (1).pdf
  overall=100.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)-(d) answered in terms of p.
    - Method: 1.0
      Correct binomial modeling; proper use of complement and first-success logic.
    - Final Answer: 1.0
      Expressions are correct and equivalent to standard forms.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No errors; identities like 1−p^4+p^40 and combination symmetry used correctly.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately (unitless).
  Feedback:
    Excellent work. All parts are correct. In (c), 1 − p^4 + p^40 equals (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3) + p^40. In (d), using C(40,25)=C(40,15) and C(36,21)=C(36,15) shows your result matches the reference form.

[0012] Q3AA (2).pdf
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (d) not computed exactly as required.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup in (a),(b); (c) misinterprets X<=4 by omitting X=0; (d) uses an approximation instead of the proper conditional calculation.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) incorrect; (d) incorrect/approximate.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic mistakes; errors are conceptual.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately.
  Feedback:
    Good on (a) and (b). For (c), X<=4 includes X=0, so P(X<=4)=p^40+q(1+p+p^2+p^3), not 1−p^4. For (d), compute exactly: P(E∩{X<=4})=p^25 q^15[ C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14) ], hence P(E|X<=4) = p^25(1−p)^15[ C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14) ] / [ p^40 + (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3) ]. Avoid approximations.

[0013] Q3AA (3).pdf
  overall=60.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)–(d) attempted.
    - Method: 0.0
      Binomial model missing coefficients in (a),(b); incorrect handling of X≤4 in (c); independence wrongly assumed in (d).
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts incorrect: (a),(b) lack C(40,k); (c) misses +p^40; (d) conditional probability set up incorrectly.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/rounding issues; errors are conceptual.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities provided; units appropriate.
  Feedback:
    Use the Binomial distribution. Correct forms: (a) C(40,30)(1−p)^30 p^10. (b) ∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1−p)^k p^{40−k}. (c) P(X≤4)=p^{40}+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1−p^4+p^{40} (include the no‑B case). (d) Don’t assume independence: P(E|X≤4) = [p^{25}(1−p)^{15} ∑_{i=1}^{4} C(40−i,14)] / [p^{40}+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0014] Q3AA (4).pdf
  overall=80.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)-(d) answered with explicit expressions.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial modeling is correct in (a),(b); however, (c),(d) incorrectly ignore the X=0 case.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) and (d) incorrect due to missing P(X=0) term in conditioning.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Combinatorial factors and algebra (e.g., numerator in (d)) are correctly computed.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities given appropriately; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    - (a) Correct: C(40,30)(1−p)^30 p^10.
    - (b) Correct: sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1−p)^k p^{40−k}.
    - (c) Incorrect: you must include X=0. Correct P(X≤4) = p^{40} + (1−p)(1 + p + p^2 + p^3) = p^{40} + 1 − p^4.
    - (d) Numerator is fine: p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,25) − C(36,21)]. Denominator should be P(X≤4) = p^{40} + 1 − p^4, not 1 − p^4.

[0015] Q3AA (5).pdf
  overall=30.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Answers given for (a)-(d), but (b) is incomplete (uses ellipsis) and forms are not fully specified.
    - Method: 0.0
      Did not use the binomial model for vote counts or geometric/negative-binomial reasoning for the first B voter.
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts are incorrect; do not match the required probability expressions in terms of p.
    - Arithmetic: 0.5
      No meaningful computations shown; missing combinatorial factors and exponents (e.g., (a) needs C(40,30) q^30 p^10).
    - Unit: 0.5
      Probabilities should be in [0,1]; expressions like 30(1−p) can exceed 1.
  Feedback:
    Use q = 1−p. (a) and (b) require binomial probabilities: C(40,k) q^k p^{40−k}. (c) is P(X≤4)=p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3). (d) condition on X=i for i=1..4, count remaining votes for B (14 of the remaining 40−i), then divide by P(X≤4).

[0016] Q3AA (6).pdf
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) omits the X=0 case; (d) ignores the conditioning.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial setup correct for (a),(b); geometric idea in (c) but missed special case; (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) missing p^40 term; (d) should be conditional, not P(E).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/algebra mistakes in the provided expressions.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities correctly unitless.
  Feedback:
    Good use of binomial for (a),(b). For (c), include X=0 (no B): P(X≤4)=p^40+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3). For (d), E is not independent of X≤4; the correct form is P(E|X≤4)=p^25(1−p)^15[C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14)] / [p^40+(1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

  overall=80.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Provided answers for (a)–(d).
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup in (a),(b); in (c) omitted X=0 case; in (d) incorrectly treated events as independent.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct. (c) should be p^{40} + (1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3). (d) needs P(E ∩ {X≤4}) in numerator, not P(E).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Algebra (e.g., (1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1-p^4) is correct.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities are unitless; notation acceptable.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the binomial model in (a) and (b). In (c), X≤4 also includes the case of no B votes; add p^{40}, so P(X≤4)=p^{40}+(1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3). In (d), E and {X≤4} are not independent; use P(E|X≤4)=P(E∩{X≤4})/P(X≤4)=p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] / [p^{40}+(1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

  overall=25.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all parts (a)–(d).
    - Method: 0.0
      Misinterpreted p (p is for A, so B is 1−p); omitted X=0 case in (c); ignored conditioning in (d).
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts incorrect: (a)(b) swap p and 1−p; (c) missing p^40 term; (d) conditional ≠ unconditional.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Binomial forms/exponents structurally fine; errors are conceptual, not computational.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately.
  Feedback:
    Let q=1−p be P(B). (a) Use C(40,30) q^30 p^10. (b) Sum k=30..40: C(40,k) q^k p^{40−k}. (c) Include X=0: P(X≤4)=p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3). (d) P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] / [p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0019] Q3AA (9).pdf
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) gives P(X=4) instead of P(X≤4), and (d) ignores the conditioning on X≤4.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup in (a),(b). For (c) need to sum P(X=i) for i=1..4 and include X=0; for (d) must apply conditional probability using the joint with X≤4.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      Parts (a),(b) correct; parts (c),(d) incorrect for the quantities asked.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Algebraic forms and exponents are correct where provided (e.g., p^3(1-p)).
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the binomial model in (a) and (b). For (c), you need P(X≤4), not just P(X=4): P(X≤4)=p^{40}+(1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3). For (d), condition on X≤4: P(E|X≤4) = p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(39,14)+C(38,14)+C(37,14)+C(36,14)] / [p^{40} + (1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)].

[0020] Q3AA (10).pdf
  overall=80.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all parts (a)–(d) with expressions in p.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial/complement and geometric reasoning correct for (a)–(c); (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      Correct for (a)–(c); (d) is incorrect—numerator needs conditioning on first B position.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Algebraic forms are sound; 1 − p^4 + p^40 matches p^40 + (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3).
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities are unitless as appropriate.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a)–(c). For (d), E is not independent of X ≤ 4. Compute P(E ∩ X ≤ 4) = p^25 (1−p)^15 [C(40,15) − C(36,15)] by summing over the first B at i=1..4, then divide by P(X ≤ 4) = p^40 + (1−p)(1+p+p^2+p^3).
