[0004] Q3A (1).txt
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Parts (a) and (b) answered correctly; (c) and (d) are incomplete/incorrect (student gave P(X=4) and unconditional P(E) instead of requested probabilities).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Correct binomial approach for (a),(b). Method for (c) and (d) is flawed or missing conditioning.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) correct. (c) should be P(X\le4), not P(X=4). (d) should be P(E|X\le4), not P(E).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Expressions are concise and clear for correct parts; reasoning/steps for conditional probabilities are omitted.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic expressions correct where given; missing terms lead to incorrect final results in (c),(d).
  Feedback:
    (a) Correct: C(40,30)*(1-p)^30 p^10. (b) Correct: \sum_{x=30}^{40} C(40,x) (1-p)^x p^{40-x}. (c) Incorrect: student gave P(X=4)=p^3(1-p). The requested P(X\le4)=\sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40}=1-p^4+p^{40}. (d) Incorrect: student gave P(E) only. With q=1-p, P(E and X\le4)=q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)], so P(E|X\le4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] / (1-p^4+p^{40}).

[0005] Q3A (2).docx
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted but key components are missing (binomial coefficients in (a),(b)) and (c),(d) omit important terms/conditions.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Major conceptual errors: omitted combinatorial factor for binomial probabilities, omitted the X=0 case in (c), and incorrectly treated events in (d) as independent.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Final expressions are incorrect/incomplete for (a)-(d).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Answers are concise and readable, but lack justification and omit necessary steps.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic omissions and incorrect probability combinations (e.g., missing coefficients and terms) make calculations inaccurate.
  Feedback:
    Major issues: (a) and (b) lack the binomial coefficients. Correct (a): C(40,30)*(1-p)^{30} p^{10}. (b): sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) (1-p)^k p^{40-k}. (c) You omitted the case X=0 (no B); P(X<=4)=1-p^4+p^{40}. (d) E and {X<=4} are not independent; the correct conditional probability is
    P(E|X<=4) = [ (1-p)^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) - C(36,15)) ] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}), where C(n,k) are binomial coefficients and q=1-p.

[0006] Q3A (2).pdf
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts (a)-(d) are answered, but essential steps and justifications are missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Major conceptual errors: omitted binomial coefficients in (a),(b); failed to include X=0 term in (c); incorrect approach to conditional probability in (d).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Answers are incorrect (missing combinatorial factors in (a),(b); (c) missing p^{40}; (d) wrongly multiplies probabilities instead of conditioning).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is very terse with little or no explanation of steps; reasoning is not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebra/formula errors (missing combinatorial terms and incorrect probability operations).
  Feedback:
    Main issues: 1) For counts use binomial coefficients. Correct answers (with q = 1-p):
    (a) P(B=30)=C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}.
    (b) P(B≥30)=∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}.
    (c) P(X≤4)=∑_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1}q + p^{40} = 1 - p^{4} + p^{40} (you omitted the p^{40} term).
    (d) Use conditioning: P(E|X≤4) = P(E ∩ {X≤4}) / P(X≤4). With E ⇔ B=15, P(E ∩ {X≤4}) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) - C(36,15)], so
    P(E|X≤4) = q^{15} p^{25} [C(40,15) - C(36,15)] / (1 - p^{4} + p^{40}).
    Fix these mistakes: include combinatorial factors, account for X=0, and compute the intersection for conditional probability rather than multiplying marginals.

[0007] Q3A (2).png
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are answered, but parts (c) and (d) omit/approximate important cases (the possibility of no B votes) and lack required exact derivation.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      (a) and (b) use the correct binomial model. (c) incorrectly omits the X=0 case; (d) uses an unjustified approximation and incorrect conditioning.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}, not 1 - p^4. (d) result is incorrect—numerator and denominator for the conditional probability are wrong.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Parts (a)/(b) are concise and clear. (c)/(d) include vague justification (e.g. 'very likely', 'approx') instead of exact probability reasoning.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      (a)/(b) calculations are accurate. (c)/(d) contain calculation/conditioning errors (missing p^{40} term and using P(E) in place of P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4})).
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b): the binomial expressions are correct. For (c), remember to include the case X=0 (no one votes for B), so P(X ≤ 4)=1−p^4+p^{40}. For (d), you cannot approximate P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) by P(E); instead compute P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) = P(B=15) − P(first 4 all A and B=15) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)] with q=1−p, and divide by P(X ≤ 4)=1−p^4+p^{40} to get the conditional probability.

      No explanatory steps shown; expressions are terse and unjustified.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Arithmetic and combinatorial factors are incorrect or missing.
  Feedback:
    Most answers are incorrect. Correct results (with q = 1-p): (a) P(B=30)=C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}. (b) P(B≥30)=∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}. (c) P(X≤4)=∑_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1} q + p^{40} = 1−p^{4}+p^{40}. (d) P(E|X≤4)= [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) − C(36,15))] / (1−p^{4}+p^{40}). Review binomial distribution for (a),(b), the geometric/shifted-geometric for (c), and conditioning for (d).

[0009] Q3A (4).docx
  overall=9.1, weighted=9.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All four parts are answered, but answers lack necessary steps and justification.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Incorrect methods used (not using binomial/ geometric distributions); fundamental approach is wrong.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      All provided final answers are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.0
      No explanatory reasoning or intermediate steps shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Formulas and calculations are incorrect or nonsensical for the problem.
  Feedback:
    Your answers are incorrect. Correct expressions (with q = 1−p):
    (a) P(B exactly 30) = C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}.
    (b) P(B ≥ 30) = sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40−k}.
    (c) P(X ≤ 4) = sum_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1} q + p^{40} = 1 − p^{4} + p^{40}.
    (d) Let q=1−p and B=15 for A=25: P(E | X ≤ 4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) − C(36,15))] / (1 − p^{4} + p^{40}).
    Review binomial and geometric distributions and show intermediate steps next time.

[0010] Q3A (4).pdf
  overall=9.1, weighted=9.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Student provided answers for all parts, but essential steps and correct expressions are missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Incorrect approach: the problem requires binomial probabilities and first-success (geometric) reasoning; student used incorrect/linear expressions.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      All four final answers are incorrect. Correct results are (with q=1-p): (a) C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}; (b) sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}; (c) 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}; (d) [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15)-C(36,15))] / (1 - p^{4} + p^{40}).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.0
      No intermediate steps or explanations were given, so reasoning is not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Expressions are mathematically incorrect for the stated probabilities; arithmetic/formula application errors.
  Feedback:
    The answers show a misunderstanding of binomial and geometric/first-success reasoning. Rework using: treat number of B votes as Binomial(n=40, q=1-p) for (a)-(b); for (c) compute P(first B by position 4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1} (1-p) + p^{40} = 1-p^4+p^{40}; for (d) condition on X≤4 and count configurations with exactly 15 B votes while excluding cases where first four are all A. Show steps and binomial coefficient reasoning.

[0011] Q3A (4).png
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are answered, but parts (c) and (d) lack necessary correct steps and explanations.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Parts (a) and (b) use correct binomial reasoning; parts (c) and (d) misinterpret the event X ≤ 4 and use incorrect conditioning.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) is incorrect (should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}). (d) is incorrect—numerator must be P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}), not P(E).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Explanation is terse and omits justification for key steps in (c) and (d), causing the conceptual error to be unclear.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra is correct where applied, but calculations for (c) and (d) omit necessary terms (subtracting/conditioning), leading to wrong results.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). Errors occur in (c) and (d): P(X ≤ 4) is not p^4 (that is P(no B in first 4)). Correctly, P(X ≤ 4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}q + p^{40}=1 - p^4 + p^{40}. For (d), you must use P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) as the numerator. The correct conditional probability is [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) - C(36,15))] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}), where q = 1 - p.

[0012] Q3A (4).txt
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted, but (c) and (d) omit the case X=0 (probability p^{40}), which is an essential term.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Approach is correct for (a),(b) and for counting in (d), but the handling of X≤4 incorrectly ignores the X=0 event.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) should be 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}. (d) numerator is correct but denominator should be 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is mostly clear and logical, but the explicit dismissal 'ignoring X=0 because the probability is very small' is unjustified and harms clarity.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Symbolic calculations are correct (binomial choices are consistent), aside from the omitted p^{40} term which affects results for (c) and (d).
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b) and on the numerator for (d). The key mistake is omitting the event X=0 (no B votes), which has probability p^{40} and must be included when computing P(X ≤ 4). Correct answers: (c) P(X ≤ 4)=1 - p^{4} + p^{40}. (d) same numerator you gave but divided by 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}.

[0013] Q3A (5).docx
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Parts (a) and (b) answered; (c) omitted the X=0 case (no B votes) and (d) only gives P(E) not the conditional P(E|X≤4).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Binomial and geometric ideas used correctly for (a)-(b)-(c) structure, but (c) missed the event X=0 and (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) is missing the +p^{40} term. (d) is incorrect/incomplete — the conditional was not computed.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning is concise and mostly clear, but (d) lacks the necessary conditional argument and (c) fails to note the X=0 definition.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra in (a) and (b) is accurate; (c)'s sum is correct for first-4 but misses p^{40}; (d) has no correct calculation.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). For (c) remember X=0 is allowed (no one votes B), so add P(X=0)=p^{40}; thus P(X≤4)= (1-p)+p(1-p)+p^2(1-p)+p^3(1-p)+p^{40} = 1-p^4+p^{40}. For (d) you cannot assume independence. Compute P(E ∩ {X≤4}) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] with q=1-p, then divide by P(X≤4)=1-p^4+p^{40} to get P(E|X≤4).

[0014] Q3A (5).pdf
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) omitted the no-B case (X=0) and (d) did not provide the requested conditional probability.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Binomial and geometric ideas used correctly for (a),(b); (c) nearly correct but missed p^{40}; (d) incorrectly assumed independence between E and {X ≤ 4}.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) is missing +p^{40}. (d) is incorrect — you gave P(E) not P(E|X ≤ 4).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is concise and mostly clear for (a)-(c); (d) lacks explanation and justification for the independence claim.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic forms are correct where given, but (c) omission and (d) missing conditional calculation are errors.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). For (c) remember to include the possibility that no one votes B (X=0), so P(X ≤ 4)= (1-p)+p(1-p)+p^2(1-p)+p^3(1-p)+p^{40} = 1-p^4 + p^{40}. For (d) you must compute P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) and divide by P(X ≤ 4); do not assume independence. One convenient form is (with q=1-p): P(E|X ≤ 4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) − C(36,15))] / (1 − p^{4} + p^{40}).

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All four parts answered with appropriate expressions.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of binomial and geometric/record-first-occurrence reasoning.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Final expressions are correct and equivalent to the reference answers.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Steps are clear; you correctly caught and handled the X=0 case in (c).
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Algebra and combinatorial terms are manipulated correctly (combinatorial equivalences used).
  Feedback:
    Good work — all parts are correct. Minor remark: your choices of binomial indices are equivalent to the reference (e.g., C(40,25)=C(40,15), C(36,21)=C(36,15)). Final answers: (a) C(40,30)(1−p)^{30}p^{10}; (b) sum_{r=30}^{40} C(40,r)(1−p)^r p^{40−r}; (c) 1−p^4 + p^{40}; (d) [(1−p)^{15} p^{25} (C(40,25) − C(36,21))] / (1−p^4 + p^{40}).

[0016] Q3A (5).txt
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted, but parts (c) and (d) omit the case X=0 and the correct conditional intersection, so essential pieces are missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods for (a) and (b) are correct. For (c) the P(X=0)=p^40 term was omitted. For (d) the student used P(E)/P(X≤4) incorrectly instead of P(E∩{X≤4})/P(X≤4).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Answers (a) and (b) are correct. Answers (c) and (d) are incorrect (missing +p^40 in (c) and wrong numerator in (d)).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is concise and mostly clear, but justification for excluding X=0 is missing and conditional probability step is applied incorrectly.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra and summation for (a),(b),(c) (excluding omitted term) are done correctly. Calculation for (d) uses an incorrect probability rather than the intersection.
  Feedback:
    Good: parts (a) and (b) are correct (binomial expressions). Mistakes: in (c) you omitted the possibility X=0 (no one votes B), so P(X≤4)=1−p^4 + p^40, not 1−p^4. In (d) you cannot write P(E|X≤4)=P(E)/P(X≤4) because E is not independent of the event {X≤4}; you must compute P(E∩{X≤4}) which equals q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)], giving P(E|X≤4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}) where q=1−p.

[0017] Q3A (6).docx
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts (a)-(d) are answered, but parts (c) and (d) omit necessary cases/steps (the no-B case and correct intersection for the conditional).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods for (a) and (b) are correct. For (c) the X=0 case was omitted; for (d) the conditional was treated incorrectly as P(E)/P(X<=4).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) is incorrect — the numerator must be P(E ∩ {X<=4}), not P(E).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is generally clear and concise, but the logical omission (X=0) and missing intersection argument for the conditional reduce clarity of the final steps.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic manipulations are correct where applied, but calculations miss the p^{40} term in (c) and the correct numerator in (d).
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b) — those binomial expressions are correct. Mistakes: (c) you omitted the case X=0 (no one votes B), which contributes p^{40}; so P(X<=4)=1-p^4+p^{40}. (d) you cannot write P(E|X<=4)=P(E)/P(X<=4). The numerator must be P(E ∩ {X<=4}) = P(B=15) − P(first 4 are A and B=15) = (1-p)^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)]. Hence P(E|X<=4) = ( (1-p)^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)] ) / (1-p^4+p^{40}), with (1-p)=q.

[0018] Q3A (6).pdf
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts answered, but parts (c) and (d) omit/ignore the case X=0 and the correct conditioning; essential steps missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods for (a) and (b) are correct (binomial). Error in (c): omitted the event X=0. Error in (d): incorrectly used P(E)/P(X<=4) instead of P(E and X<=4)/P(X<=4).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Answers (a) and (b) are correct. (c) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40} (missing p^{40}). (d) is incorrect; numerator must be P(E ∩ {X≤4}), not P(E).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is generally clear and concise, but reasoning omitted handling of the 'no B' case and the intersection needed for the conditional probability.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra and combinatorial expressions in (a),(b) are correct. Minor logical/calculation omission in (c) and (d) affects results.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b) — those binomial expressions are correct. Two issues: (c) you omitted the possibility X=0 (no B voters), so P(X≤4)=1−p^4+p^{40}, not 1−p^4. (d) P(E|X≤4)≠P(E)/P(X≤4); you must compute P(E ∩ {X≤4}) then divide by P(X≤4). The correct numerator is q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] with q=1−p, giving P(E|X≤4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)] / (1−p^4+p^{40}).

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra for (a)/(b) is correct; (c) missing +p^{40}; (d) gives P(E) not P(E|X≤4).
  Feedback:
    (a) Correct: C(40,30)*(1-p)^30*p^10. (b) Correct: sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)*(1-p)^k*p^{40-k}. (c) You omitted the case X=0 (no B). Correct P(X ≤ 4)= (1-p)+p(1-p)+p^2(1-p)+p^3(1-p)+p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) You wrote P(E) only. E = {B=15}. Compute P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) = C(40,15) q^{15} p^{25} - p^4 C(36,15) q^{15} p^{21} = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] with q=1-p. Hence P(E | X ≤ 4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}).

      Uses binomial form appropriately, but misapplies p (probability of A) vs q = 1−p for votes for B and omits an important case in (c).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Most final expressions are incorrect: (a),(b) swap p and 1−p; (c) omits the no-B case; (d) gives unconditional probability instead of the required conditional.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some answers are terse and lack justification (especially (c),(d)); the logic behind the conditional probability in (d) is missing.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic forms are written correctly in binomial style, but the underlying assignments (which variable is p vs 1−p) are incorrect and one term is omitted in (c).
  Feedback:
    Major issues: you treated p as the probability of a vote for B, but the problem defines p as P(A). Let q = 1−p = P(B). Correct answers: (a) P(B exactly 30)=C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}. (b) P(B≥30)=sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}. (c) P(X≤4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1} q + p^{40} = 1−p^4 + p^{40} (include the no-B case X=0). (d) P(E|X≤4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) − C(36,15))] / (1−p^4 + p^{40}). Fix the p vs 1−p swap and include the p^{40} term in (c); then compute the conditional in (d) rather than quoting the unconditional probability.

    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Method uses incorrect assignment of p (swapped A/B) and omits the no-B case for (c); approach for (d) ignores conditioning effect.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Final expressions for (a),(b),(c),(d) are incorrect as given (except the unconditional P(E) form happens to match but the conditional answer is wrong).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is concise but too terse and does not justify key steps (e.g., omission of X=0 and the conditioning in (d)).
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic forms contain sign/assignment errors (p vs 1-p) and a missing term p^{40} in (c).
  Feedback:
    Main issues: you treated p as P(B) in (a)-(b) though the problem defines p = P(A); you omitted the no-B case (X=0) when computing P(X ≤ 4). Correct answers: let q = 1-p. (a) P(B=30)=C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}. (b) P(B≥30)=sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}. (c) P(X ≤ 4)=sum_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1} q + p^{40} = 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}. (d) P(E|X ≤ 4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) - C(36,15))] / (1 - p^{4} + p^{40}), with q = 1-p.

    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      (a) and (b) methods are correct; (c) and (d) show a conceptual gap (omitting the no-B case and misapplying conditioning).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) and (d) are incorrect as written.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps are generally clear, but the reasoning that X=0 contributes to P(X≤4) and how to compute P(E∩{X≤4}) is missing.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic manipulations shown are correct for the parts addressed, but calculations omit the p^{40} term and the corrected intersection term for (d).
  Feedback:
    Parts (a) and (b) are correct. For (c) you must include the case X=0 (no B votes), so P(X≤4)= (1-p)+p(1-p)+p^2(1-p)+p^3(1-p)+p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. Part (d) is not simply P(E)/P(X≤4) because E and {X≤4} are not independent. The correct numerator is P(E ∩ {X≤4}) = (1-p)^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) - C(36,15)], so P(E|X≤4) = ( (1-p)^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] ) / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}).

      Responses are terse; reasoning for (d) (multiplying probabilities) is stated implicitly but incorrect.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Key algebraic/combinatorial factors are missing, leading to incorrect probabilities.
  Feedback:
    Errors to fix: (a),(b) are binomial probabilities and must include binomial coefficients: P(B=30)=C(40,30)*(1-p)^30*p^10 and P(B>=30)=sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)*(1-p)^k*p^{40-k}. (c) X<=4 includes the possibility X=0 (no B), so P(X<=4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}, not 1-p^4. (d) You cannot multiply P(A=25) by P(X<=4); need P(E and X<=4)/P(X<=4). Correct numerator: P(B=15 and at least one B among first 4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] with q=1-p. Thus P(E|X<=4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}).

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic expressions given are computed correctly where applicable, but applied to the wrong events in (c) and (d).
  Feedback:
    (a) and (b) are correct. For (c) you gave P(X=4)=p^3(1-p), but the question asks P(X≤4). Correct: P(X≤4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40}=1-p^4+p^{40}. For (d) you wrote the unconditional P(A=25)=C(40,25)p^{25}(1-p)^{15}, but the problem asks for P(E | X≤4). Correct conditional probability: numerator = P(E ∩ {X≤4}) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] (where q=1-p), so P(E|X≤4) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)] / (1-p^4+p^{40}).

The correct P(X≤4)=\sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40}=1-p^4+p^{40}. (d) Incorrect: C(40,25)p^{25}(1-p)^{15} is P(E) (unconditional). You must compute P(E ∩ {X≤4}) and divide by P(X≤4). The correct conditional probability is [ (1-p)^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15)-C(36,15)) ] / (1-p^4+p^{40}), where q=1-p. Fix (c) and (d) by using these expressions.

      Major conceptual errors: p was misinterpreted (problem states p = P(A)), and X was treated as 'number of B votes' instead of 'position of first B'.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Final expressions are incorrect under the given definitions (p = P(A), X = index of first B).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Explanations are very brief and contain incorrect statements about variable meanings, causing confusion.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra is internally consistent with the student's incorrect assumptions, but not correct for the stated problem.
  Feedback:
    Main errors: the problem defines p as P(A), so let q = 1 - p = P(B). Also X is the position of the first B, not the total number of B votes. Correct answers (in terms of p and q=1-p): (a) C(40,30) q^{30} p^{10}. (b) sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) q^{k} p^{40-k}. (c) P(X <= 4) = sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1} q + p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) P(E | X <= 4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) - C(36,15))] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}). Fix the variable interpretations and re-derive accordingly.

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra in (a),(b) is accurate. (c) misses +p^{40}; (d) contains incorrect approximation instead of exact combinatorial subtraction.
  Feedback:
    Good correct answers for (a) and (b). Mistake in (c): you must include the case X=0 (no B votes), so P(X≤4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}q + p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) cannot be approximated by P(E)/(1-p^4). Exact approach: let q=1-p and E = {B=15}. Then P(E∩{X≤4}) = P(B=15) - P(first 4 are A and B=15) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15) - C(36,15)]. Hence P(E|X≤4) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15) - C(36,15)] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}).

      Symbolic calculations are accurate for (a)-(c); (d) contains a logical/calculation omission affecting the result.
  Feedback:

    P(E | X ≤ 4) = (1-p)^{15} p^{25} [C(40,15) - C(36,15)] / [1 - p^{4} + p^{40}], where 1-p is the probability of a B vote.

  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). Mistakes in (c) and (d): for (c) recall X=0 if no one votes B, so P(X\le4)=P(first B in 1..4)+P(X=0)=\sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40}=1-p^4+p^{40}, not 1-p^4. For (d) you cannot assume independence. Let q=1-p. P(E) means B=15. P(E ∩ {X\le4}) = P(B=15) − P(first 4 are A AND B=15) = C(40,15) q^{15}p^{25} − p^4 C(36,15) q^{15} p^{21} = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)].

Correctly, P(X<=4)=sum_{k=1}^{4} p^{k-1}q + p^{40} = 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}. Error in (d): you cannot approximate P(E and X<=4) by P(E). Exact numerator is P(B=15 and at least one B in first 4)=P(B=15) - P(first 4 all A and B=15)=q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15)-C(36,15)].

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted, but part (c) omits the X=0 case and part (d) lacks the required calculation and uses an unjustified approximation.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Parts (a) and (b) use correct binomial reasoning. Parts (c) and (d) contain conceptual gaps (missed p^{40} term in (c); incorrect approach in (d)).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Answers (a) and (b) are correct. Answer (c) is incorrect (missing +p^{40}), and (d) is incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning for (a),(b) is clear. Explanations for (c) and especially (d) are incomplete and rely on an unjustified approximation.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic binomial expressions in (a),(b) are correct. Formulas in (c) and (d) are missing terms or computed incorrectly.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b). For (c) remember to include the possibility that no one votes for B (X=0), so P(X ≤ 4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}q + p^{40} = 1 - p^4 + p^{40} (with q=1-p). For (d) you cannot approximate P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) by P(E). Correctly, P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) = P(B=15) - P(first 4 are A and B=15) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15) - C(36,15)], so
    P(E | X ≤ 4) = q^{15} p^{25} [C(40,15) - C(36,15)] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}).

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Student attempted all parts but key steps (binomial coefficients, conditioning) are missing or incomplete.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Major method errors: omitted binomial coefficients in (a)/(b) and used wrong distribution for X in (c).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Final expressions are incorrect for (a)-(c); (d) incorrectly claimed unsolvable.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some attempt at explanation, but reasoning is terse and several steps are unclear or incorrect.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic/probability formula mistakes (missing combinatorial factors, incorrect PMF for first success).
  Feedback:
    Major issues: (a) and (b) omit the binomial coefficient C(40,k). Correct answers: (a) P(B=30)=C(40,30)(1-p)^{30}p^{10}. (b) P(B≥30)=sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1-p)^k p^{40-k}. (c) The first-B distribution is geometric: P(X=k)=p^{k-1}(1-p) for k≥1, with P(X=0)=p^{40}. Hence P(X≤4)=sum_{k=1}^4 p^{k-1}(1-p)+p^{40}=1−p^4+p^{40}. Your sum (1−p)+(1−p)^2+... is incorrect. (d) It is solvable in terms of p: with q=1−p, P(E∩{X≤4})=q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)], so P(E|X≤4) = q^{15}p^{25}[C(40,15)−C(36,15)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}). Please correct the missing combinatorial factors and the geometric-PMF usage.

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)–(d) are answered.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Correct methods for (a)–(c). Part (d) uses P(E) instead of P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}), missing the conditioning step.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a)–(c) are correct. (d) is incorrect because the numerator should exclude configurations where the first four are all A.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is concise and mostly clear, but (d) lacks the needed decomposition/explanation for the intersection.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra is correct for (a)–(c). (d) has a logical/calculation omission affecting the result.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a)–(c); those expressions are correct. The error is in (d): you used P(E) as the numerator for P(E | X ≤ 4). The numerator should be P(E ∩ {X ≤ 4}) = P(B=15) − P(first 4 are A and B=15) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)], where q=1−p. Thus P(E | X ≤ 4) = q^{15} p^{25}[C(40,15) − C(36,15)] / (1 − p^{4} + p^{40}). Fix that subtraction to correct (d).

  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted, but you omitted the X=0 case (probability p^{40}) in part (c) and therefore in the denominator of part (d).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods for (a),(b) and the numerator in (d) are correct. However, you mistakenly excluded the event X=0, which is required for exact probabilities in (c) and (d).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) and (d) are incorrect because the term p^{40} was omitted; the correct denominator in (d) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is mostly readable, but the statement 'ignoring X=0 because the probability is very small' is unjustified and led to a wrong result.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic manipulations are correct (note C(36,21)=C(36,15)), but the omission of p^{40} produced incorrect final expressions for (c) and (d).
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b); your binomial expressions are correct. The main error is omitting the event X=0 (probability p^{40}). Correct answers: (c) P(X <= 4) = 1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) P(E | X <= 4) = [p^{25}(1-p)^{15} (C(40,25) - C(36,21))] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}), noting C(40,25)=C(40,15) and C(36,21)=C(36,15). Include the X=0 term in (c) and propagate it into (d).

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts are attempted, but you omitted the X=0 case (probability p^{40}) in parts (c) and (d).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods for (a),(b) and the numerator in (d) are correct; incorrectly excluded the p^{40} term when computing P(X ≤ 4) and the conditional denominator.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) and (b) are correct. (c) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}; (d) has the wrong denominator (should use 1 - p^4 + p^{40}).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is concise and mostly clear, but the justification 'ignoring X=0 because very small' is unjustified—must include exact term.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebra and combinatorics are handled correctly (C(36,21)=C(36,15)), aside from the omitted p^{40} contributions.
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b) and on setting up the numerator in (d). The main error is excluding the event X=0 (no B votes) which has probability p^{40}. Correct answers: (c) P(X ≤ 4)=1 - p^4 + p^{40}. (d) P(E | X ≤ 4)= [p^{25}(1-p)^{15}(C(40,25)-C(36,21))] / (1 - p^4 + p^{40}). Include the p^{40} term to fix (c) and the conditional denominator.

  overall=65.9, weighted=65.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All four parts (a)–(d) are answered and key steps are shown.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Methods are largely correct, but part (c) omitted the case X=0 (no B votes), which also affects part (d).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Parts (a) and (b) are correct; parts (c) and (d) are incorrect because P(X≤4) omitted the p^{40} term.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Work is clear and logically organized; steps are easy to follow.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Algebraic manipulations are mostly correct; the missing p^{40} is the main calculation/logic error. Note C(36,21)=C(36,15) and C(40,25)=C(40,15).
  Feedback:
    Good work on (a) and (b); your combinatorial expressions are correct. The error is in (c): X≤4 includes the event X=0 (no one votes B), whose probability is p^{40}, so P(X≤4)=1 - p^{4} + p^{40}, not 1 - p^{4}. That omission carries into (d): your numerator for P(E ∩ {X≤4}) is correct (you can write it as p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,25)-C(36,21)], noting the symmetry to C(40,15)-C(36,15)), but the conditional probability should be divided by 1 - p^{4} + p^{40}. Fixing that yields P(E|X≤4) = p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,25)-C(36,21)] / (1 - p^{4} + p^{40}).

  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Student answered all parts but omitted necessary steps and failed to provide correct conditional work for (d).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Method contains major errors (swapped probabilities for A and B, omitted the X=0 term, and ignored conditioning).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Final answers are incorrect for (a)-(d); the unconditional (d) is correct but the conditional result is missing/wrong.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Explanations are terse and sometimes unclear (e.g., 'doesn't change the total count much'); reasoning for conditional probability is missing.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic mistakes: p and 1-p are interchanged, and the p^{40} term for X=0 was omitted.
  Feedback:
    Key errors: p is the probability of voting for A, so probability for B is q = 1-p. Correct answers:
    (a) P(B=30) = C(40,30) (1-p)^{30} p^{10}.
    (b) P(B≥30) = sum_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k) (1-p)^{k} p^{40-k}.
    (c) P(X ≤ 4) = 1 - p^{4} + p^{40} (include the no-B case X=0).
    (d) With q=1-p, P(E|X≤4) = [q^{15} p^{25} (C(40,15) - C(36,15))] / (1 - p^{4} + p^{40}).
    Fix these swaps and include the X=0 term; recompute (d) by conditioning as shown.
