[0001] Q5A (1).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Correct thresholds provided, but you did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as requested in part (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Used the likelihood-ratio thresholds correctly for ML, MAP, and Bayes (min-cost).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Threshold values and the part (b) threshold are numerically correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is very terse; steps are stated but derivations and brief explanations are omitted.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric evaluations (2, ≈3.15, ≈0.85, and ≈0.28) are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good work on finding the thresholds and the miss-rate constraint point. To complete the answer, compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule. For reference: ML (τ=2): P_M=Φ(-2)≈0.0228, P_FA=1−Φ(2)≈0.0228. MAP (τ≈3.149): P_M≈0.1978, P_FA≈0.00083. Min-cost (τ≈0.846): P_M≈0.00081, P_FA≈0.198. Constraint τ≈0.281 gives P_M=1e-4 and P_FA≈0.3896.

[0002] Q5A (2).pdf
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provides decision thresholds for (a) but omits the required miss and false-alarm rates; (b) solved the wrong constraint and notes the error.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Likelihood-threshold approach is used correctly for (a) thresholds, but the cost-ratio and (b) target (miss vs false alarm) are mishandled.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values for ML, MAP and min-cost are essentially correct (minor rounding); overall answers lack the requested error rates and (b) is incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Answer is terse and mostly clear for thresholds but omits intermediate steps and explicit computations of error probabilities; student does acknowledge their mistake in (b).
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Numeric thresholds are accurate to given precision; the calculation in (b) targets the wrong rate (false alarm) instead of the miss rate.
  Feedback:
    Good start: you correctly obtained the ML, MAP and min-cost thresholds (x>2, ≈3.15, ≈0.85). However you did not compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for those rules as requested. Also part (b) asked to keep the miss rate ≤0.01% but you solved for the false-alarm rate instead. Correct (b): require Φ(τ−4) ≤ 1e-4 ⇒ τ ≤ 4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ 0.281, giving P_M=1e-4 and P_FA≈1−Φ(0.281)≈0.3896 (≈38.96%). Provide the error probabilities for each rule to complete the solution.

[0003] Q5A (3).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provided thresholds and qualitative comparison, but did not compute the numerical miss and false-alarm probabilities or show likelihood-ratio steps.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct approach (likelihood-ratio reasoning and use of normal quantile for the target miss rate).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Reported thresholds (ML=2, MAP≈3.15, min-cost≈0.85) and γ≈0.281 correctly.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning is concise and directionally correct but sparse; key derivation steps (e.g., expression for the likelihood ratio and threshold formulas) are omitted.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric values and quantile used are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good work — you identified the correct ML, MAP and min-cost thresholds and found the γ that achieves the required miss rate. To complete the answer, show the likelihood-ratio inequality that yields each threshold and compute the corresponding miss and false-alarm probabilities numerically (e.g., ML: P_M=P_FA≈0.0228; MAP: P_M≈0.1978, P_FA≈0.00083; min-cost: P_M≈0.00081, P_FA≈0.198). Including those Φ evaluations will fully address part (a).

[0004] Q5A (4).pdf
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      You gave thresholds for (a) and a value for (b) but omitted the required miss and false-alarm rates and supporting steps.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Method is incorrect for MAP and min-cost: you compared likelihood expression to raw ratios instead of taking logarithms; thresholds are wrong.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Most reported thresholds are incorrect (MAP and min-cost). Only ML (x>2) and the b) value (~0.28) are close/correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some work shown and you noted an error, but steps are minimal and contain algebraic mistakes; transitions unclear.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic manipulations are wrong (e.g., 4x-8>99 → x>26.75 is invalid for the LR rule).
  Feedback:
    Major issues: for MAP and min-cost you must compare the log-likelihood 4x-8 to the log of the threshold (ln(P(H0)/P(H1)) and ln((P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01))). Correct thresholds are ML: x>2; MAP: x>(8+ln99)/4 ≈3.149; Min-cost: x≈0.846. Also compute and report miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use Φ). Part (b) τ≈0.281 is fine, but state resulting P_M and P_FA. Fix the algebra and include the error-rate calculations.

[0005] Q5A (5).pdf
  overall=77.3, weighted=77.3
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      You gave all decision thresholds but did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as requested in (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio approach and use of thresholds for ML, MAP, and Bayes (min-cost) rules.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values are essentially correct (ML 2, MAP ≈3.15, min-cost ≈0.85, constraint τ≈0.30) but error rates were omitted; a small prior approximation (used 100 vs 99) was made.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Steps are concise and easy to follow.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical approximations are reasonable; minor rounding (e.g., ln99≈4.6 and using prior ratio 100) does not materially change thresholds.
  Feedback:
    Good work — you applied the likelihood-ratio method correctly and obtained the right thresholds. To complete the solution, compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use P_M = Φ(τ−4) and P_FA = 1−Φ(τ)) and report those numbers for ML, MAP and min-cost. Also state the chosen τ and the resulting P_M and P_FA for part (b). Note the tiny approximation you made using prior ratio 100 instead of 99; it changes thresholds only slightly.

[0006] Q5A (6).pdf
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts (ML, MAP, min-cost, constraint) were attempted, but key computations for min-cost and (b) are incorrect.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Major conceptual errors: costs were swapped in the min-cost rule and the required miss rate 0.01% was mistaken for 0.01.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      ML and MAP thresholds are correct, but the min-cost threshold and the result in (b) are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is readable and the student even noted errors; however the chain of reasoning around key thresholds was flawed.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Numeric application mistakes (swapped costs, wrong probability value for 0.01%) lead to incorrect thresholds and error rates.
  Feedback:
    Good: ML (x>2) and MAP (~x>3.15) are correct and clearly presented. Problems: you swapped the costs when computing the min-cost threshold and used 0.01 instead of 0.0001 for the 0.01% miss-rate requirement. Correct min-cost threshold: use (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01) = (0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099 ⇒ 4x-8>ln(0.0099) ⇒ x≈0.846. This gives P_M≈Φ(0.846−4)≈8.1e-4 (0.081%) and P_FA≈1−Φ(0.846)≈19.9%. For part (b), require P_M≤1e-4 ⇒ z=Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈−3.719 ⇒ τ=4+z≈0.281, giving P_FA≈1−Φ(0.281)≈38.96%. Fix those two mistakes and your solution will be correct.

[0007] Q5A (7).pdf
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Found thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost and gave part (b) threshold, but did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as required in (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood-ratio thresholds and Neyman–Pearson style reasoning; min-cost and MAP thresholds derived correctly.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are essentially correct (ML=2, MAP≈3.15, min-cost≈0.85, part (b) k≈0.29), but omission of requested error rates prevents full credit.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is terse but understandable; some intermediate steps (e.g., posterior/likelihood-ratio relation for MAP) are not shown explicitly.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical calculations and inversion of the normal CDF are accurate (minor rounding only).
  Feedback:
    Good: you correctly obtained the ML, MAP and min-cost thresholds (x>2, x≈3.15, x≈0.85) and the miss-rate constraint threshold (k≈0.29). Missing: you did not compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for ML, MAP and min-cost as the problem asked — include P_M and P_FA for each rule (use Φ to express them). Also show briefly how the MAP threshold follows from the likelihood ratio > P(H0)/P(H1) to make the derivation explicit.

[0008] Q5A (8).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds and part (b) answered, but the student did not compute the numerical miss and false-alarm rates requested for (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of log-likelihood ratio, MAP and Bayes/min-cost threshold formulas and cost/prior ratio.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Computed thresholds (ML: 2, MAP ≈ 3.15, min-cost ≈ 0.85, constraint t ≈ 0.28) are correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps are concise and mostly clear, but the comparison of miss and false-alarm rates is only qualitative rather than giving the requested numerical values.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical approximations (ln values and quantile ≈ -3.72) are accurate to presented precision.
  Feedback:
    Good work: the LLR and all decision thresholds are correct and calculations are accurate. To complete the answer, compute and report the numeric miss and false-alarm probabilities for ML, MAP and min-cost rules (e.g., ML: P_M = Φ(-2)=0.0228, P_FA=0.0228; MAP: P_M≈0.1978, P_FA≈0.00083; min-cost: P_M≈0.00081, P_FA≈0.198). Include those numbers and briefly compare them to satisfy the full prompt.

[0009] Q5A (9).pdf
  overall=36.4, weighted=36.4
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      ML answered but MAP and min-cost decisions are incorrect or not computed numerically; error rates mostly missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      ML method is correct; MAP formula was misapplied and min-cost test not derived properly.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Key numerical thresholds are wrong (MAP, min-cost, part b); final answers are therefore incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some steps shown and a self-note about a wrong formula, but overall reasoning for MAP/min-cost and part (b) is unclear.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      ML arithmetic is correct; MAP and part (b) use incorrect approximations (e.g., treating 0.01% as exactly 4σ).
  Feedback:
    Good start with the ML threshold (τ=2). Major issues: the MAP threshold was computed with a wrong formula — the likelihood-ratio test gives 4x−8>ln(P(H0)/P(H1)), so τ_MAP=(8+ln99)/4≈3.15 (not 6.6). The min-cost threshold should use (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01) = (0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099, leading to 4x−8>ln0.0099 and τ_cost≈0.846. For part (b) require Φ(τ−4)≤1e−4 so τ≤4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 (not 0); this yields P_FA≈39%. Recompute error rates from these correct thresholds. Fixing these points will make the solution complete and correct.

[0010] Q5A (10).pdf
  overall=90.9, weighted=90.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All decision rules and thresholds are derived and part (b) addressed, but the student gave only qualitative comparisons instead of explicit numerical miss and false-alarm rates for each rule.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of the likelihood ratio, MAP and Bayes cost thresholds; priors and costs applied properly.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds (ML x>2, MAP x≈3.15, min-cost x≈0.846) and the miss-rate constraint threshold (γ≈0.281) are correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Steps are clear and logically ordered; derivations are easy to follow.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical logs and arithmetic are accurate and consistently rounded.
  Feedback:
    Good, correct derivations and thresholds. To complete the comparison, compute the numeric miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (e.g., for ML: P_M = Φ(-2)=0.0228, P_FA=1-Φ(2)=0.0228; for MAP and min-cost likewise) and report the false-alarm rate for γ≈0.281 (≈0.3896) so the trade-offs are quantified.

[0011] Q5AA (1).docx
  overall=90.9, weighted=90.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All decision rules and thresholds are given, and part (b) answered, but the student did not compute the numerical miss and false-alarm probabilities requested for comparison.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood ratio and correct threshold formulas for ML, MAP, and min-cost.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds (ML x>2, MAP x≈3.15, min-cost x≈0.846) and part (b) γ≤0.281 are correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Derivations are clear and logically presented.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic and logarithm approximations are accurate (minor rounding acceptable).
  Feedback:
    Good solution: LR and thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost are correct and part (b) is correct (γ ≈ 0.281). To be complete, report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule as requested (e.g., ML τ=2 ⇒ P_M=P_FA=Φ(-2)=0.0228; MAP τ≈3.15 ⇒ P_M≈0.1978, P_FA≈0.00083; min-cost τ≈0.846 ⇒ P_M≈0.00081, P_FA≈0.198). Small rounding on ln(99) is fine.

[0012] Q5AA (2).docx
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds and (b) threshold given, but the required comparison of miss and false-alarm rates is missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio approach and correct threshold expressions.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values are correct, but the answer omits the numerical miss/false-alarm rates required by the question.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Answer is concise and clear on thresholds but lacks intermediate steps (likelihood-ratio derivation and probability formulas) and the requested comparisons.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric evaluations (2, ≈3.15, ≈0.85, ≈0.28) are computed correctly.
  Feedback:
    Good job finding the ML, MAP and min-cost thresholds and the (b) threshold. However you did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as requested. Use P_M(τ)=Φ(τ−4) and P_FA(τ)=1−Φ(τ). For reference: ML (τ=2): P_M=Φ(−2)=0.0228, P_FA=0.0228. MAP (τ≈3.149): P_M≈0.1978, P_FA≈0.00083. Min-cost (τ≈0.8462): P_M≈0.00081, P_FA≈0.198. For (b) τ≈0.281: P_M=1e-4, P_FA≈0.3896. Include these probability computations and a brief LR derivation (Λ(x)=exp(4x−8)) next time.

[0013] Q5AA (3).docx
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      You gave thresholds for the three rules but did not compute the miss and false-alarm rates for part (a); part (b) did not address the requested miss-rate constraint.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost are derived correctly, but in (b) you applied the constraint to the false-alarm rate instead of the miss rate (conceptual mix-up).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values reported are essentially correct, but final error-rate answers are missing for (a) and incorrect target in (b).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is very terse and omits intermediate steps (likelihood-ratio derivation and computations of Φ expressions), though the endpoints shown are recognizable.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Numeric thresholds are accurate (ML: 2, MAP ≈ 3.15, min-cost ≈ 0.85). The z-value used in (b) is correct for 1e-4 but was applied to the wrong probability.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of the three decision thresholds (ML: x>2; MAP: x≈3.15; min-cost: x≈0.85). However, you omitted the miss/false-alarm rates for part (a). In part (b) you constrained the false-alarm rate by mistake. The requirement P_M ≤ 1e-4 (miss rate) gives Φ(τ−4)=1e-4 ⇒ τ = 4 + Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ 0.2810. That achieves P_M = 1e-4 and yields P_FA = 1−Φ(0.2810) ≈ 0.3896 (≈39.0%). Include the likelihood-ratio derivation and compute P_M and P_FA for each rule to complete the solution.

[0014] Q5AA (4).docx
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provides thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost and answers (b), but does not compute the numerical miss and false-alarm rates requested or show key intermediate derivations.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Approach is correct: thresholds and direction of shifts are right; use of z-score for part (b) is appropriate.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Reported thresholds (2, ≈3.15, ≈0.85) and γ≈0.281 are correct, but missing the requested numeric error rates for each rule.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning is concise and understandable, but sparse—key formulas (likelihood ratio, threshold expressions) and intermediate steps are omitted.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric values shown are accurate (ML=2, MAP≈3.15, min-cost≈0.85, γ≈0.281).
  Feedback:
    Good work: you found the correct decision thresholds (ML 2, MAP ≈3.15, min-cost ≈0.85) and the γ ≈0.281 for the 0.01% miss constraint. To complete the solution, show the likelihood-ratio derivation (Λ(x)=exp(4x−8)) and compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (e.g. ML: P_M=Φ(−2)=0.0228, P_FA=1−Φ(2)=0.0228; MAP and min-cost similarly). Including those numeric error rates and the threshold formulas will earn full credit.

[0015] Q5AA (5).docx
  overall=36.4, weighted=36.4
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Both parts attempted, but (a) missing the required miss and false-alarm rates and (a) thresholds for MAP and min-cost are incorrect.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Wrong application of the likelihood-ratio test for MAP and min-cost: you compared 4x-8 to the ratio itself instead of its natural log.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      ML threshold (x>2) and part (b) value (~0.28) are correct, but MAP and min-cost thresholds are incorrect and error rates are omitted.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is terse; you note an error but do not correct it or show the correct derivation and resulting error probabilities.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Calculations for ML and part (b) are fine, but arithmetic following incorrect inequalities produced wrong thresholds for MAP and min-cost.
  Feedback:
    Main issues: for MAP and min-cost you must compare the log-likelihood ratio (i.e. 4x-8) to the natural log of the threshold, not to the threshold itself. Correct thresholds: ML τ=2 (correct), MAP τ=(8+ln(99))/4≈3.149, min-cost τ=(8+ln(0.0099))/4≈0.846. Also compute the miss and false-alarm rates for each rule (e.g. using Φ). Part (b) x≈0.281 is correct. Fix the MAP/min-cost derivations and add the error-rate calculations.

[0016] Q5AA (6).docx
  overall=56.8, weighted=56.8
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost and the miss-rate constraint are given, but the student did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates numerically as requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Approach is correct and yields the right thresholds, but the student approximated the prior ratio as 100 (should be 99) and did not explicitly state the likelihood-ratio decision rule.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Reported thresholds (ML: 2, MAP ≈ 3.15, min-cost ≈ 0.85, constraint ≈ 0.3) are essentially correct, but the required error-rate values/comparisons are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is concise and mostly clear, but some steps are terse and the prior ratio approximation is presented without justification.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric computations and rounding are accurate and consistent with standard approximations.
  Feedback:
    Good work — you found the correct decision thresholds with reasonable rounding. To complete the answer, explicitly compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use Φ and 1−Φ values) and state the comparisons. Also correct the minor prior-ratio wording (0.99/0.01 = 99) or note the approximation if using 100.

[0017] Q5AA (7).docx
  overall=50.0, weighted=50.0
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts (a) and (b) are attempted, but important steps/values are incorrect in min-cost and part (b).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      ML and MAP methods used correctly; min-cost formula was applied with swapped costs and part (b) used wrong target probability.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      ML (τ=2) and MAP (τ≈3.15) are correct, but min-cost threshold and the constraint threshold in (b) are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps are terse but mostly clear; the key algebraic error (costs swapped) is visible.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Numerical work for ML/MAP is accurate; min-cost and part (b) contain arithmetic/interpretation errors.
  Feedback:
    Good that you identified ML and MAP thresholds correctly. Two main errors: (1) For the min-cost Bayes rule you swapped costs in the likelihood-ratio threshold. The correct ratio is (P(H0)·C10)/(P(H1)·C01) = (0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099, giving τ≈0.846 (not x>5.45). (2) In (b) the required miss rate is 0.01% = 1e-4, not 0.01. The z-value is about −3.719, so τ ≈ 4 − 3.719 = 0.281 (yielding P_FA ≈ 39%). Fixing those yields the min-cost and constraint results matching the reference.

[0018] Q5AA (8).docx
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Answered both parts and gave thresholds, but did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct application of ML, MAP, and Bayesian min-cost decision rules and use of Gaussian tail quantiles.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds (ML: 2, MAP ≈ 3.15, min-cost ≈ 0.85) and Part B k ≈ 0.29 are correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is terse and mostly clear, but contains a confusing numeric expression for the min-cost ratio and lacks explicit error-rate explanations.

  Feedback:
    Good work — you obtained the correct thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost, and the miss-rate constraint. To complete the answer, explicitly compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (e.g., P_M = Φ(τ−4), P_FA = 1−Φ(τ)) and report them (including the FA resulting from the Part B threshold, ≈ 39%). Also fix the written min-cost ratio expression to clearly show the prior×cost terms to avoid confusion.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood ratio and correct derivation of ML, MAP and Bayes (min-cost) thresholds; correct approach for part (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Threshold values (ML x>2, MAP x≈3.15, min-cost x≈0.85, constraint t≈0.28) are correct.

  Feedback:
    Good work — LLR and all thresholds are correct and calculations are accurate. To fully satisfy (a), compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities numerically for each rule (e.g., ML: P_M = Φ(-2)=0.0228, P_FA = 1−Φ(2)=0.0228; MAP and min-cost as in the reference).

      Answers were provided for parts (a) and (b) but key quantities (error rates, correct thresholds, and derivations) are missing or not shown.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Incorrect application of MAP threshold and min-cost rule; reasoning about thresholds is flawed (wrong formula usage).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Numeric thresholds and final values are incorrect (e.g. MAP and part (b)). Only ML threshold was correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some steps are stated (ML threshold), but several steps are hand-waved or admitted incorrect; explanation lacks necessary intermediate derivations.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Calculations (MAP threshold, chosen numeric values, and the miss-rate→threshold mapping in (b)) are incorrect.
  Feedback:
    You correctly identified the ML threshold x>2, but MAP and min-cost thresholds are wrong and part (b) is incorrect. MAP should use Lambda > P(H0)/P(H1) giving τ ≈ 3.149 (not 6.6 with your formula). The Bayes min-cost threshold uses (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01) and gives τ ≈ 0.846. To achieve miss rate ≤0.01% you need τ ≈ 0.281 (not 0); this yields P_M ≈ 1e-4 and P_FA ≈ 39%. Revise using the likelihood ratio Lambda(x)=exp(4x−8) and the standard normal CDF Φ to compute error probabilities.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct approach using likelihood ratios and correct intuition about how priors/costs shift the threshold.

    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric values and the z-value used are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good work — you obtained the correct decision thresholds and the constrained threshold for the required miss rate. To improve: show the likelihood-ratio inequality used to get each threshold (write the explicit formulas for ML, MAP using prior ratio, and min-cost using the cost×prior ratio), and compute/report the actual numerical miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule. Also remove or explain the unexplained symbol γ in part (b) and show the short step converting Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ -3.719 to τ = 4 + z.

    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Likelihood-ratio thresholds in (a) are correct; in (b) the method was applied to the false-alarm tail rather than the miss tail.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds (a) are essentially correct (rounded). Part (b) is incorrect — the correct τ for miss ≤0.01% is ≈0.281, not 3.72.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is terse but readable; the student did note their own mistake, which helps clarity.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Numeric thresholds are rounded reasonably (ML 2, MAP 3.15, min-cost 0.85). The 3.72 value is correct for a 0.01% false-alarm requirement but was applied to the wrong constraint.
  Feedback:
    Good: ML, MAP, and min-cost thresholds are correct (rounded). Missing: you did not compute the corresponding miss/false-alarm rates for (a). Error in (b): you solved for FA ≤0.01% instead of miss ≤0.01%. Correction: to get miss ≤0.01% (1e-4), require τ ≤ 4 + Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ 0.281; this yields P_M = 1e-4 and P_FA = 1−Φ(0.281) ≈ 0.3896 (≈39%).

      Correct likelihood-ratio approach and correct threshold expressions for ML, MAP, and min-cost rules.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values and the constraint solution are correct, but omission of the error-rate computations reduces completeness of final results.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps shown are concise and mostly clear, but key comparisons (P_M and P_FA calculations) are missing.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric approximations (3.15, 0.85, 0.28) are accurate to the given precision.
  Feedback:
    Good: all three decision thresholds are correct and the miss-rate constraint solution is right (x ≈ 0.281). Missing: compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for ML, MAP, and min-cost so the required comparison is complete. For reference: ML (τ=2) P_M=P_FA≈2.28%; MAP (τ≈3.149) P_M≈19.8%, P_FA≈0.083%; Min-cost (τ≈0.846) P_M≈0.081%, P_FA≈19.8%; constraint τ≈0.281 gives P_M=0.01%, P_FA≈38.96%.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio approach and correct decision-threshold formulas for ML, MAP, and Bayes (min-cost).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values and the miss-rate constraint are correct, but some requested numeric error rates were omitted.

      Overall reasoning is clear, but there are a few typographical/formatting issues (e.g., concatenated expressions) that hinder readability.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical evaluations (ln values and resulting thresholds) are computed accurately.
  Feedback:
    Good work: you derived the likelihood ratio and obtained the correct thresholds for ML (x>2), MAP (x≈3.15), min-cost Bayes (x≈0.846), and the constraint threshold for P_M≤0.01% (x≈0.281). Fix the minor formatting typos in the MAP line. To complete the answer, compute the numerical miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (e.g., P_M = Φ(τ−4), P_FA = 1−Φ(τ)) and report them as in the reference solution.

      Answered all parts at a high level but omitted key calculations (min-cost threshold) and gave incorrect numeric results for MAP and part (b).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      ML was done correctly, but MAP used an incorrect threshold formula and min-cost rule was not computed from the likelihood ratio and cost/prior ratio.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      ML threshold is correct (τ=2). MAP, min-cost, and the threshold for the required miss rate are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Explanations are brief; the student notes an error for MAP but does not show the correct derivation or values for the other rules.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Some calculations are correct (ML), but others misuse formulas (MAP) or give incorrect numeric thresholds (part b).
  Feedback:
    Good start: the ML threshold τ=2 is correct. Major issues: (1) MAP threshold was computed with the wrong formula — the likelihood-ratio test gives 4x−8>ln(P(H0)/P(H1)), so τ_MAP=(8+ln99)/4≈3.149, not ≈6.6. (2) The min-cost threshold must use (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01)=0.0099 leading to τ_cost≈0.846 (you should show this calculation). (3) For part (b) set Φ(τ−4)=1e-4 ⇒ τ=4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈0.281, not 0. Your answer is partially correct but missing/incorrect key computations — show the likelihood ratio thresholds and compute the corresponding error probabilities to improve.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood ratio, priors, and cost ratio to derive thresholds; approach is appropriate.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values (x>2, x>3.15, x>0.85, t≈0.28) are correct, but final error-rate numbers were omitted.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning for (a) is concise and clear; part (b) contains garbled notation (probability expressions) that reduces clarity.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric approximations (ln values, thresholds, and the 0.28 result) are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good work deriving the LLR and the three decision thresholds—ML (2), MAP (~3.15), min-cost (~0.85)—and finding the threshold ~0.28 to meet the miss-rate constraint. To complete the solution, explicitly compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use Φ for the normal CDF, e.g. for ML P_M = Φ(2-4)=Φ(-2)=0.0228 and P_FA = 1-Φ(2)=0.0228). Also clean up the notation in part (b): show the inversion step Φ(τ−4)=1e-4 ⇒ τ=4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4) and then compute P_FA=1−Φ(τ).

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood ratio, MAP and Bayes cost threshold formulas; approach is appropriate.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Threshold values are essentially correct (ML: 2, MAP ≈ 3.15, min-cost ≈ 0.85, part (b) k ≈ 0.29) but missing the requested error-rate values for (a).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps are terse but mostly clear; would be clearer with explicit expressions for miss and false-alarm probabilities and a brief statement comparing them.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical computations and rounding are accurate and consistent.
  Feedback:
    Good work: you correctly derived the ML (x>2), MAP (~x>3.15), min-cost (~x>0.85) thresholds and the constraint threshold in (b) (~0.29). To complete the answer, compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use P_M = Φ(τ−4) and P_FA = 1−Φ(τ)). Also note the more precise values τ_map≈3.149 and τ_cost≈0.846, and the part (b) tight threshold τ≈0.281 (you used 0.29, which is acceptable rounding).

    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      ML and MAP thresholds are found correctly, but the min-cost rule derivation is incorrect (costs swapped) and the constraint in (b) is applied to the wrong probability.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Min-cost threshold and part (b) threshold are incorrect; required error rates are missing or wrong.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.0
      Min-cost derivation is garbled with algebra/notation errors and the reasoning for (b) lacks clarity and misstates the required miss probability.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Numerical manipulation for the min-cost ratio is wrong (costs placed in wrong positions) and the z-value/threshold in (b) uses 0.01 rather than 0.0001.
  Feedback:
    Good that you correctly identified the ML (x>2) and MAP (~x>3.15) thresholds. Major issues: (1) For the min-cost rule you swapped C10 and C01; the correct likelihood-ratio threshold is (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01) = (0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099, giving 4x-8>ln(0.0099) ⇒ τ≈0.846 (not 5.45). (2) In (b) the required miss probability is 0.01% = 1e-4, not 0.01; use Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈-3.719 so τ=4-3.719≈0.281, yielding P_FA≈0.3896. Also compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use the Gaussian Φ). Fix these errors and show the Φ calculations for the comparison.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood ratio and threshold shifts for ML, MAP, and Bayes/min-cost rules; minor sloppy wording when approximating the prior ratio as 100 instead of 99.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Reported thresholds are essentially correct (ML=2, MAP≈3.15, min-cost≈0.85, constrained τ≈0.30), but final error rates (P_M and P_FA) are omitted.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps are terse but understandable; one imprecise statement ('prior ratio is 100') could confuse. More explicit intermediate formulas would improve clarity.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical approximations (ln(99)≈4.6, ln(0.01)≈-4.6, z≈-3.7) are acceptable and thresholds match reference within rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost rules and the constrained miss-rate rule. To fully answer the problem, compute and report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use P_M = Φ(τ−4) and P_FA = 1−Φ(τ)). Also avoid imprecise statements (e.g., approximating 99 by 100) — they do not change results much but can confuse the derivation. Overall arithmetic and method are sound.

    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Major conceptual error: you compared likelihood ratio to raw numeric ratios instead of taking the natural log when solving for x; min-cost rule similarly misapplied.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Only ML (x>2) and the τ≈0.28 constraint in (b) are essentially correct. MAP and min-cost thresholds are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      ML step is clear; MAP line is unintelligible. You noted an error but did not correct it or show proper steps.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Algebraic mistakes when isolating x (e.g., treating ln of ratios as the ratio itself) lead to wrong numeric thresholds.
  Feedback:
    Good that you identified ML (x>2) and gave a τ≈0.28 for the miss-rate constraint. However, for MAP and min-cost you must take logs when solving 4x-8 > ln(ratio). Correct thresholds: ML τ=2; MAP: 4x-8>ln(99) ⇒ τ≈3.1488; Min-cost: 4x-8>ln(0.0099) ⇒ τ≈0.8462. Also compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use Φ).

      Steps are brief and partially labeled; you noted the MAP mistake but did not correct it or show proper algebra.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Arithmetic/algebra for MAP and min-cost is wrong (failed to apply ln), producing wildly incorrect thresholds.
  Feedback:
    Good that you identified the ML threshold correctly and gave a reasonable value for part (b). However, for MAP and min-cost rules you must compare the log-likelihood 4x-8 to the natural logarithm of the threshold constants (e.g. ln(P(H0)/P(H1)) and ln((P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01))).

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Numeric thresholds are accurate. The z-value ~3.72 corresponds to FA=0.0001, but that was applied to the wrong probability.
  Feedback:
    Good: you found the ML, MAP and min-cost thresholds correctly (x>2, x>3.15, x>0.85). Missing/needs correction: (a) you should report the miss and false-alarm rates for each rule (ML: P_M=P_FA≈2.28%; MAP: P_M≈19.8%, P_FA≈0.083%; min-cost: P_M≈0.081%, P_FA≈19.8%). (b) The requirement is miss rate ≤0.0001, not false alarm. Solve Φ(τ−4) ≤ 1e-4 ⇒ τ ≤ 4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4)=4−3.719≈0.281. Thus pick τ≈0.281 → P_M=1e-4 and P_FA≈1−Φ(0.281)≈0.3896 (≈38.96%).

    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical approximations and arithmetic are accurate enough; minor rounding (e.g., using 100 vs 99) does not materially alter thresholds.
  Feedback:
    Good work deriving the decision thresholds using the likelihood ratio. ML, MAP, and min-cost thresholds are correct in value. Two issues: (1) you approximated the prior ratio slightly (used 100 instead of 99) — acceptable but note the exact ratio is 99; (2) you did not compute or report the miss and false-alarm probabilities for the three rules, which the problem requested. Also for part (b) you gave the threshold (~0.3) that achieves the target miss rate; please also report the resulting false-alarm rate. Add those numerical error rates to make the solution complete.

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      You gave thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost and the part (b) threshold, but you did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates as the problem requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood ratio and threshold algebra; derivations of the three decision thresholds are correct.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      The reported thresholds (2, ≈3.15, ≈0.85) and the part (b) value (≈0.28) are correct, but the required error-rate values are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Solution is very terse—steps are understandable but intermediate probability calculations and comparisons are omitted.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Algebraic manipulation and numeric evaluations shown are accurate (rounding acceptable).
  Feedback:
    Good: thresholds for ML, MAP, min-cost and the constraint threshold in (b) are correct (ML: x>2; MAP: x≈3.15; min-cost: x≈0.85; part (b): x≈0.28). To complete the answer, compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule and present them for comparison (e.g., ML: P_M=P_FA=Φ(-2)=0.0228, etc.).

  overall=29.5, weighted=29.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Both parts addressed but key results (error rates, correct min-cost threshold, and correct (b) threshold) missing or incorrect.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      ML and MAP approaches are correct; min-cost formula was applied but costs were swapped and (b) used 1% instead of 0.01%.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Several final numerical thresholds are incorrect (min-cost and (b)); error rates not provided.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Steps shown and mistakes noted, but reasoning contains confusion about cost placement and probability levels.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Numeric evaluation of the cost ratio and the miss-rate target are incorrect (major calculation errors).
  Feedback:
    Correct: ML threshold x>2 and MAP ≈ x>3.15. Errors: for min-cost you swapped costs — the threshold uses (P(H0)C10)/(P(H1)C01) = (0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099, giving τ≈0.8462 (not 5.45). Also in (b) the requirement is 0.01% = 1e-4, not 0.01; Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈−3.719 so τ=4−3.719≈0.281 and the corresponding false-alarm ≈38.96%. Correct error rates: ML P_M=P_FA≈2.28%; MAP P_M≈19.8%, P_FA≈0.083%; min-cost P_M≈0.081%, P_FA≈19.8%. Fix those sign/scale errors and report the error probabilities explicitly next time.

[0039] Q5AAAA (9).txt
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost and the Part (b) threshold are given, but you did not compute or compare the miss and false-alarm rates in part (a) as requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio approach and use of Gaussian tail/inverse CDF to get thresholds.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Final thresholds are correct: ML x>2, MAP x≈3.15, min-cost x≈0.85, and part (b) k≈0.29.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning is brief and mostly clear, but the min-cost intermediate expression shows inconsistent numbers (typo in the ratio) which could confuse readers.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric calculations and rounding are appropriate; the chosen z-value and resulting k are correct to the given precision.
  Feedback:
    Good work — you correctly derived the three decision thresholds and the threshold to meet the miss-rate constraint. However, you omitted the requested miss and false-alarm rates (and their comparison) for part (a). Also correct the minor typo/inconsistency in the min-cost ratio expression so the intermediate steps match the final value.

[0040] Q5AAAA (10).txt
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Both parts attempted, but key results missing or incorrect (no FA/miss rates for most rules; min-cost not quantified).
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Incorrect MAP threshold formula and vague/incorrect min-cost reasoning; major conceptual errors.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Only ML threshold (2) is correct. MAP, min-cost thresholds and part (b) threshold/miss-rate are incorrect.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some steps shown, but note admitting a 'wrong formula' and inconsistent statements reduce clarity.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Numeric misuse (ln99 treated incorrectly), and incorrect sigma/miss-rate relationship in part (b).
  Feedback:
    Good that you identified the ML threshold correctly (x>2). However: your MAP formula is wrong — use likelihood ratio > P(H0)/P(H1) which gives threshold τ_MAP = (8 + ln99)/4 ≈ 3.149 (not 6.6). The min-cost threshold comes from Lambda > (P0*C10)/(P1*C01) = 0.0099, giving τ_cost ≈ 0.846. You must compute miss and false-alarm probabilities from these τ values (e.g., for min-cost P_M ≈ 8.1e-4, P_FA ≈ 0.198). For (b) solve Φ(τ−4) ≤ 1e-4 → τ ≤ 4 + Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ 0.281 (not 0); this gives P_M=1e-4 and P_FA ≈ 0.3896. Fix the MAP/min-cost derivations and report the associated error rates.
