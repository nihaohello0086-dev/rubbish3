[0001] Q5A (1).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds given for ML, MAP, and min-cost, and a threshold for (b), but missing the requested miss/false-alarm rates and explicit comparison; (b) lacks P_FA.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio threshold forms and correct choice of priors/costs; correct z-quantile use for (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      All provided thresholds are numerically correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Answers are terse with minimal derivation; no stated error-rate comparison.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical evaluations (ln terms and quantile ~−3.72) are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML t=2; MAP t≈3.15; min-cost t≈0.85; and for miss≤0.01%, t≈0.28 (i.e., decide H1 if x>t). To complete (a), report and compare error rates: ML P_FA=Q(2)≈2.28e−2, P_M=Φ(−2)≈2.28e−2; MAP P_FA≈8.0e−4, P_M≈1.98e−1; min-cost P_FA≈1.98e−1, P_M≈7.9e−4. For (b), also provide P_FA=Q(0.28)≈3.9e−1.

[0002] Q5A (3).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provided thresholds and qualitative comparisons, but missing derivations and numerical false-alarm/miss rates.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Applied correct LRT-based reasoning; correct use of priors/costs and Gaussian quantile for the miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds (2, 3.15, 0.85, 0.281) and ordering of error rates are correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse and understandable but lacks shown steps/justification for thresholds.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical values are accurate to the expected approximations.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of ML/MAP/min-cost thresholds and correct qualitative trade-offs; the miss-constrained threshold is correct. To strengthen the answer, show the likelihood-ratio setup to derive thresholds and report P_FA and P_M numerically for each rule; in (b) explicitly state the decision rule (decide H1 if x > 0.281) and optionally give the resulting P_FA.

[0003] Q5A (5).pdf
  overall=63.6, weighted=63.6
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Decision thresholds given, but no miss/false-alarm rates or comparison as requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct LR-based thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost; proper z-based approach for miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are (approximately) correct, but required error rates are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse but understandable; lacks explicit LR form and comparison of error rates.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Used 100 instead of 99 for prior ratio and z≈−3.7 instead of −3.719; small approximations.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML t=2, MAP t≈3.15, min-cost t≈0.85, and miss-constrained t≈0.30. To complete (a), report and compare error rates using P_FA=Q(t), P_M=Φ(t−4): ML (t=2): P_FA≈0.0228, P_M≈0.0228; MAP (t≈3.15): P_FA≈8.0e−4, P_M≈0.198; min-cost (t≈0.846): P_FA≈0.198, P_M≈7.9e−4. For (b), a tighter value is t≈0.281 (from Φ−1(1e−4)≈−3.719), giving P_FA≈0.389. Use prior ratio 99 (not 100) for min-cost.
