[0001] Q5A (1).pdf
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds given, but (a) omits the requested miss and false-alarm rates; (b) gives threshold only.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct LR test setup and thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost; correct constraint handling for (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Numerical thresholds are correct, but missing the error-rate comparisons required in (a).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse statements without derivations; understandable but lacks the comparison requested.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Accurate arithmetic and approximations for ln and quantiles.
  Feedback:
    Good job obtaining the correct thresholds: ML x>2, MAP x>3.15, min-cost x>0.85, and for (b) x≈0.28 to achieve PM≈0.01%. However, (a) asked to compare miss and false-alarm rates; you should report them: ML: PM≈2.28%, PFA≈2.28%; MAP: PM≈19.7%, PFA≈0.082%; Min-cost: PM≈0.08%, PFA≈19.9%. For (b), the implied PFA is Q(0.28)≈38.9%.

[0002] Q5A (2).pdf
  overall=43.2, weighted=43.2
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Part (a) thresholds given but miss/false-alarm rates omitted; part (b) not answered as asked.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      LR framework and thresholds for ML/MAP correct; min-cost eta slightly off; part (b) used wrong constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Missing error rates in (a) and incorrect criterion in (b).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but too terse; notes an error without correcting it.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric thresholds well-approximated; quantile 3.72 is correct for Q^{-1}(1e-4).
  Feedback:
    Good use of the likelihood-ratio test. For (a): ML: x>2 with P_M≈0.0228, P_FA≈0.0228. MAP: x>3.149 with P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost: eta should be 0.0099 (you used 0.01), yielding x≈0.846 with P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b): you constrained false alarms instead of misses. To ensure P_M≤1e−4, set t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 and decide H1 if x>0.281; then P_FA≈Q(0.281)≈0.389.

[0003] Q5A (3).pdf
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Correct thresholds and qualitative comparisons given, but missing derivations and numerical miss/false-alarm rates; (b) lacks explicit decision statement and P_FA.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Appropriate Gaussian thresholding and correct qualitative shifts; correct z-quantile method for miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are correct, but required error rates are not computed; (b) threshold meets target.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Clear but terse; key steps (likelihood ratio, threshold formula) are not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical values (2, 3.15, 0.85, 0.281) are accurate within reasonable rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of thresholds and qualitative trade-offs. To improve, show the likelihood-ratio setup and compute the miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule. In (b), state the decision rule explicitly (decide H1 if x > 0.281) and optionally report the resulting P_FA.

[0004] Q5A (4).pdf
  overall=29.5, weighted=29.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Both parts attempted, but no miss/false-alarm rates given and part (b) lacks a clear decision rule and justification.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      MAP and min-cost tests incorrectly omit the natural log in the likelihood-ratio threshold.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      ML threshold is correct, but MAP and min-cost thresholds are wrong; part (b) value given without decision direction.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is brief and notes an error, but steps and comparisons are missing.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic consistent with your (incorrect) setup; ML and b ≈ 0.28 numerically sensible.
  Feedback:
    ML: x > 2 is correct. For MAP and min-cost, you must compare Λ(x)=exp(4x−8) to η and take ln: 4x−8 > ln η ⇒ x > 2 + (ln η)/4. MAP uses η=99, giving x>3.149; min-cost uses η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099, giving x>0.846. You did not compute or compare miss/false-alarm rates. For (b), specify the rule and target miss: choose x>4+Φ^{-1}(10^{-4})≈0.281 (miss=0.01%), with corresponding P_FA≈0.389.

[0005] Q5A (5).pdf
  overall=36.4, weighted=36.4
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Decision thresholds given, but miss and false-alarm rates not provided or compared; part (b) lacks verification of constraint.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Correct LRT-based approach and thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost; minor approximation in priors and costs; part (b) logic nearly correct but misses the ≤ constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Missing required error rates in (a); (b) threshold 0.3 does not meet the ≤0.01% miss requirement.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise and mostly clear, but lacks explicit formulas and error-rate calculations requested.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Thresholds for (a) are accurate to rounding; (b) uses z≈-3.7 instead of -3.719, yielding miss ≈1.08e-4 (>1e-4).
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML t=2; MAP t≈3.15; min-cost t≈0.85. However, you must report and compare error rates: ML P_M=P_FA≈0.0228; MAP P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4; min-cost P_M≈8.0e-4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b), to ensure P_M≤1e-4, use t≤4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈0.281 (not 0.3).

[0006] Q5A (6).pdf
  overall=43.2, weighted=43.2
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Gave ML and MAP thresholds and attempted min-cost, but no miss/false-alarm rates; part (b) lacks corresponding P_FA.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Correct LR approach for ML/MAP, but min-cost threshold used swapped costs; miss-rate constraint misread (0.01 vs 0.01%).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      ML/MAP thresholds are fine, but min-cost and (b) thresholds are incorrect; required error-rate comparisons are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse notes with an acknowledged mistake but not corrected; lacks structured comparison.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic is consistent with your setup; ML/MAP numerics are reasonable.
  Feedback:
    ML: x>2 and MAP: x>3.15 are correct, but you must report miss and false-alarm rates. Min-cost: you swapped the costs; use η=(P(H0)C_FA)/(P(H1)C_M)=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099, giving x>0.846 with P_M≈8.0e-4 and P_FA≈0.199. For (b), 0.01% means 1e-4: set t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈0.281 so x>0.281, yielding P_FA≈0.389. Also, ML error rates: P_M=P_FA≈0.0228; MAP: P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4.

[0007] Q5A (7).pdf
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Correct thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost, and a valid k for part (b), but missing the required miss and false-alarm rates comparison in (a); (b) did not explicitly state the decision rule form.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Proper likelihood-ratio approach, correct use of priors and cost ratio, and correct quantile method for the miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      ML t=2, MAP t≈3.15, min-cost t≈0.85, and k≈0.29 are all correct within rounding.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Reasoning is terse; derivations and the requested error-rate comparison are not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical values (ln 0.0099 ≈ −4.61; k from z ≈ −3.71) are accurate within acceptable rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML x>2, MAP x>≈3.15, min-cost x>≈0.85, and for the miss constraint k≈0.29. However, part (a) asked to compare miss and false-alarm rates, which you did not provide. For completeness, approximate rates: ML P_M≈2.28%, P_FA≈2.28%; MAP P_M≈19.7%, P_FA≈0.082%; min-cost P_M≈0.08%, P_FA≈19.9%. For k≈0.29 in (b), the implied rule is decide H1 if x>k, with P_FA≈0.39.

[0008] Q5A (8).pdf
  overall=77.3, weighted=77.3
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provided correct thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost and a threshold for (b), but did not compute or report the miss and false-alarm rates as requested; only qualitative comparison. No P_FA for part (b).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct LLR setup, threshold tests, and use of priors/costs to set eta; proper Gaussian tail reasoning for (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      All thresholds are correct, and the (b) threshold meets the miss constraint, but missing numerical error rates for comparison reduces correctness.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Concise and readable steps with appropriate formulas and thresholds.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical values and approximations (ln terms, thresholds) are accurate within acceptable rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good derivation of LLR and thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost, and correct threshold for the miss constraint in (b). However, you were asked to compare miss and false-alarm rates; you should compute P_M = Φ(t−4) and P_FA = Q(t) numerically for each rule (and optionally P_FA for part (b)).

[0009] Q5A (9).pdf
  overall=15.9, weighted=15.9
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Addressed ML/MAP/min-cost qualitatively and gave a threshold for (b), but omitted error rates and numeric thresholds for MAP/min-cost; no comparisons provided.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      MAP threshold formula incorrect (missing 1/4 factor). Min-cost not derived using Bayes risk. For (b), 0.01% tail is not 4σ; must use Gaussian quantile.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      ML t=2 is correct; MAP t=6.6 is wrong; min-cost threshold not computed; (b) t=0 satisfies the constraint but is not the tight solution.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some rationale provided, but steps are sparse and note acknowledges a wrong formula without correction.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Missed the (ln η)/4 term for Gaussian thresholds and misinterpreted the 0.01% quantile (≈3.72σ, not 4σ).
  Feedback:
    Use Λ(x)=p(x|H1)/p(x|H0)=exp(4x−8) and decide H1 if x>t with t=2+(ln η)/4. ML: η=1 → t=2, P_FA=Q(2)=0.0228, P_M=Φ(−2)=0.0228. MAP: η=P(H0)/P(H1)=99 → t≈3.149, P_FA≈8.2e−4, P_M≈0.197. Min-cost: η=[P(H0)C_FA]/[P(H1)C_M]=0.0099 → t≈0.846, P_FA≈0.199, P_M≈8.0e−4. For P_M≤10^−4, set t=4+Φ^{-1}(10^−4)≈0.281 (your t=0 is conservative but not tight), giving P_FA≈0.389.

[0010] Q5A (10).pdf
  overall=77.3, weighted=77.3
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Decision thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost and (b) given, but miss and false-alarm rates were not computed numerically.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct LRT formulation, priors/cost usage, and threshold derivations.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are correct; missing the requested numerical error rates for (a).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Clear, step-by-step derivation and justified comparisons.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Accurate logs, algebra, and Z-value; thresholds match expected values.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the likelihood ratio test: ML x>2, MAP x>3.15, and min-cost x>0.846 are correct, and the (b) threshold 0.281 meets the miss constraint. To fully answer (a), compute and report P_M and P_FA for each rule (e.g., P_M=Φ(t−4), P_FA=Q(t)) with numerical values. In (b), explicitly state the rule “decide H1 if X>0.281” (you may also report the resulting P_FA).

[0011] Q5AA (1).docx
  overall=77.3, weighted=77.3
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Correct ML/MAP/min-cost thresholds and (b) threshold found, but (a) lacks numerical miss/false-alarm rates, and (b) does not explicitly state the decision rule (decide H1 if x > 0.281).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Proper likelihood-ratio test with correct priors and cost-based threshold formulation.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are correct; missing the requested numerical error rates for (a) and explicit decision rule statement in (b).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 1.0
      Logical, step-by-step derivation with clear inequalities and interpretations.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Algebra and numerical approximations (ln values, z-quantile) are accurate; thresholds match expected values.
  Feedback:
    Good derivation of LRT and thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost. To fully answer (a), compute and report the numerical miss and false-alarm probabilities for each threshold. In (b), explicitly state the rule: decide H1 if x > 0.281 (which achieves miss ≤ 0.01%).

[0012] Q5AA (2).docx
  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Decision thresholds provided for ML, MAP, min-cost, and (b), but miss and false-alarm rates for (a) were not computed/compared as requested.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of Gaussian LRT thresholds and quantile condition for the miss-rate constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      All thresholds are correct, but required error-rate comparisons are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but too terse; lacks the steps/formulas linking likelihood ratio to the threshold and the error-rate expressions.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric evaluations (2, 3.15, 0.85, 0.28) are accurate within reasonable rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML x>2; MAP x>3.15; min-cost x>0.85; and for miss≤0.01%, x>0.28. However, (a) requires comparing error rates: ML P_M≈0.0228, P_FA≈0.0228; MAP P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4; min-cost P_M≈8.0e-4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b), stating the decision rule explicitly (decide H1 if x>0.28) and optionally P_FA≈0.389 would complete the answer.

[0013] Q5AA (3).docx
  overall=47.7, weighted=47.7
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.0
      Missing miss/false-alarm rates and their comparison in (a); (b) addresses the wrong constraint.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Correct LR framework and thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost; (b) applies FA constraint instead of miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      (a) thresholds essentially correct (min-cost η≈0.0099); (b) incorrect requirement; error rates not provided.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse statements without derivations; note of the mistake helps but steps are not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerics you did are consistent: t_ML=2, t_MAP≈3.15, t_cost≈0.85 (η≈0.0099), and Q(γ)=1e−4 gives γ≈3.72.
  Feedback:
    For (a), in addition to the thresholds, report P_M and P_FA for each rule (e.g., ML: P_M=P(X≤2|H1)=Φ(−2)≈0.0228, P_FA=Q(2)≈0.0228). For min-cost use η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099 (t≈0.846). For (b), enforce the miss constraint: choose t so Φ(t−4)=1e−4 ⇒ t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281, then P_FA=Q(0.281)≈0.389.

[0014] Q5AA (4).docx
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Correct thresholds and qualitative comparisons given, but numerical miss/false-alarm rates for (a) are omitted.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Approach aligns with LRT for ML/MAP/min-cost and the direction of threshold shifts is correct.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds t_ML=2, t_MAP≈3.15, t_cost≈0.85 are correct; ordering of error rates is correct; t≈0.281 for 10^-4 miss is correct.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Explanation is very brief; lacks explicit decision rule statements and computed error probabilities.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical values and use of quantile (−3.719) are accurate.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of the correct thresholds and qualitative error-rate ordering. To be complete, include the actual miss and false-alarm probabilities for each rule (use Φ/Q), and state the decision rules explicitly as “decide H1 if x > t.” Your part (b) threshold for a 10^-4 miss rate is correct.

[0015] Q5AA (5).docx
  overall=43.2, weighted=43.2
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Gave thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost and part (b), but omitted required miss and false-alarm rates.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      MAP and min-cost tests misapplied; you must compare the likelihood ratio exp(4x−8) to the threshold and take natural logs.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      ML threshold correct; MAP and min-cost thresholds incorrect; part (b) threshold value is essentially correct but missing decision direction.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is very terse; noted an error but did not correct it or show steps.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic consistent with your (incorrect) setup; numeric value in (b) is a good approximation.
  Feedback:
    ML: correct, decide H1 if x > 2. For MAP and min-cost, use Λ(x)=exp(4x−8) and take ln: decide H1 if 4x−8 > ln η. MAP: η=99 ⇒ t≈2+ln(99)/4≈3.149, so P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost: η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099 ⇒ t≈2+ln(0.0099)/4≈0.846, so P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. You omitted the error rates for ML: P_M=P_FA≈0.0228. (b) To ensure miss ≤ 0.01%: choose t so Φ(t−4)=1e−4 ⇒ t≈0.281; decide H1 if x>0.281; corresponding P_FA≈0.389.

[0016] Q5AA (6).docx
  overall=63.6, weighted=63.6
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Gave ML/MAP/min-cost thresholds and a threshold for (b), but did not compute/compare miss and false-alarm rates as requested in (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Used correct LRT framework and threshold shift t = 2 + (ln η)/4; priors/costs incorporated appropriately.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are essentially correct (minor rounding), but required error rates for (a) are missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but omits key steps (error-rate computation) and explicit decision statements/comparison.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Minor numeric approximations; used 100 instead of 99 for prior ratio; z ≈ -3.7 vs −3.719. Impact is small.
  Feedback:
    Good identification of thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost rules and a reasonable threshold for the 0.01% miss constraint. To complete (a), compute and compare P_M = Φ(t−4) and P_FA = Q(t) for each threshold (e.g., ML t=2 gives P_M≈0.0228, P_FA≈0.0228; MAP t≈3.15 gives P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4; min-cost t≈0.85 gives P_M≈8e-4, P_FA≈0.20). In (b), explicitly state the decision (decide H1 if x > t) and, optionally, report the resulting P_FA.

[0017] Q5AA (7).docx
  overall=43.2, weighted=43.2
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Answered ML and MAP thresholds; min-cost attempted but wrong; no miss/false-alarm comparisons; part (b) lacks correct rule.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Used LR-thresholding and Gaussian quantiles, but swapped costs in min-cost and used 0.01 instead of 0.01% in (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Only ML and MAP thresholds correct; min-cost threshold and (b) are incorrect; missing requested error rates.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but omits key steps and comparisons; notes own errors but does not correct them.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic and logarithms done correctly given the (incorrect) setups; MAP rounding acceptable.
  Feedback:
    ML: x > 2 is correct. MAP: x > 3.15 is correct. Min-cost: you swapped the costs—correct η = (0.99·$1k)/(0.01·$10M) = 0.0099, giving threshold t = 2 + (ln η)/4 ≈ 0.846. Missing requested error rates: ML P_M=P_FA≈2.28%; MAP P_M≈19.7%, P_FA≈0.082%; min-cost P_M≈0.08%, P_FA≈19.9%. For (b), 0.01% = 1e-4: t = 4 + Φ^{-1}(1e-4) ≈ 0.281; decision: declare H1 if x > 0.281; corresponding P_FA ≈ 38.9%. Your 1.67 used 1% (0.01) and does not meet the 0.01% miss constraint.

[0018] Q5AA (8).docx
  overall=63.6, weighted=63.6
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Provided thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost and a threshold for part (b), but did not compute/compare miss and false-alarm rates as requested in (a).
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Used correct likelihood-ratio test and appropriate thresholds; approach is sound.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds are correct, but missing error rates for (a); minor inconsistency in min-cost ratio expression.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but sparse; min-cost derivation has a confusing ratio, though the final threshold is correct.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Final thresholds are numerically correct; the written ratio (0.991000/0.0110000000) is incorrect even though it was simplified to the correct 0.0099.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds: ML x>2, MAP x>3.15, min-cost x>0.85, and for miss≤0.01% x≈0.29. However, (a) requires error rates: ML P_M=P_FA≈0.0228; MAP P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4; min-cost P_M≈8.0e-4, P_FA≈0.199. Also, your min-cost ratio expression is inconsistent: it should be η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099 (ln η≈−4.615). For (b), explicitly state the rule: decide H1 if x>k (k≈0.29).

  Feedback:
    Use the likelihood-ratio test Λ(x)=exp(4x−8) and threshold η. With equal variances, decide H1 if x>t where t=2+(ln η)/4. ML: η=1 ⇒ t=2, P_M=P_FA≈0.0228. MAP: η=P(H0)/P(H1)=99 ⇒ t≈3.149, P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost: η=(P0 C_FA)/(P1 C_M)=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099 ⇒ t≈0.846, P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. For P_M≤1e−4, choose t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 (not 0); then P_FA≈0.389.

    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      Thresholds ML=2, MAP≈3.15, min-cost≈0.85, and miss-constraint threshold ≈0.281 are correct; qualitative error-rate ordering is correct.

  Feedback:
    Good identification of models and correct thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost. To complete (a), compute the actual miss and false-alarm probabilities using P_M=Φ(t−4) and P_FA=Q(t): ML t=2 gives P_M=P_FA≈0.0228; MAP t≈3.149 gives P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4; min-cost t≈0.846 gives P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b), clearly state the decision rule: decide H1 if x>0.281, which achieves P_M=1e−4; the corresponding P_FA is Q(0.281)≈0.389.

      Part (a) lacks required error rates; part (b) solves the wrong constraint. Correct (b) threshold: x > 0.281 for P_M ≤ 10^-4.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise but too terse; missing steps for computing error probabilities and the criterion in (b).
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical thresholds in (a) acceptable; Q(γ)=1e-4 ⇒ γ≈3.72 computed correctly; main issue is the wrong metric in (b), not arithmetic.
  Feedback:
    Good LRT formulation and thresholds for ML/MAP/min-cost (η=1→t=2; η=99→t≈3.15; η≈0.0099→t≈0.846). You needed to report P_M and P_FA for each rule. For (b), you enforced false-alarm ≤0.01% instead of miss ≤0.01%; the correct miss-constrained rule is x>t with t=4+Φ^{-1}(10^-4)≈0.281, yielding P_FA≈0.389.

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      MAP numeric error (used ln(99) without /4); 4-sigma approximation is inaccurate for 1e-4.
  Feedback:
    ML: X>2 is correct, but include error rates: P_M=Φ(-2)=0.0228, P_FA=Q(2)=0.0228. MAP: use LRT with t=2+(ln η)/4 and η=P(H0)/P(H1)=99 → t≈3.149, giving P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4. Min-cost: η=[P(H0)C_FA]/[P(H1)C_M]=0.0099 → t≈0.846, P_M≈8.0e-4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b), to meet P_M≤1e-4 set t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈0.281 (tight); your t=0 does satisfy the constraint (P_M≈3.2e-5) but is unnecessarily conservative.

  Feedback:
    Good derivation of LLR and thresholds: ML x>2, MAP x>3.15, min-cost x>0.85, and for (b) x>0.28. However, (a) asked to compare miss and false-alarm rates; you should report them: ML: P_M≈0.0228, P_FA≈0.0228; MAP: P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e-4; Min-cost: P_M≈8.0e-4, P_FA≈0.199.

      Only ML and MAP thresholds are correct; min-cost and (b) thresholds incorrect; required error rates missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5

    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Arithmetic for 3.15 and 1.67 is fine, but based on wrong setups for min-cost and (b).
  Feedback:
    ML: threshold x>2; miss≈2.28%, false alarm≈2.28%. MAP: threshold x>3.149; miss≈19.7%, false alarm≈8.2e−4. Min-cost: you swapped costs; correct η=(0.99·1e3)/(0.01·1e7)=0.0099 → threshold x>0.846; miss≈8.0e−4, false alarm≈0.199. (b) Target miss is 0.01% (1e−4): choose threshold t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 → decide H1 if x>0.281; false alarm≈0.389. Remember to report both miss and false-alarm rates as requested.

    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio/threshold approach and mapping ln(·)/4 shift; setup is appropriate.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      Thresholds for ML and MAP are correct; min-cost slightly off from using 100 vs 99. Part (b) threshold 0.3 yields miss ≈1.08e−4, which does not meet the ≤1e−4 requirement.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Terse but understandable; lacks explicit error-rate computation and comparison asked in (a).
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.5
      Minor numerical slips: used 100 instead of 99 for prior ratio; used z≈−3.7 leading to a miss slightly above the target.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the threshold-shift method. For (a): ML t=2 gives P_M≈Φ(−2)=0.0228 and P_FA≈Q(2)=0.0228. MAP t≈3.15 gives P_M≈Φ(−0.85)=0.197 and P_FA≈Q(3.15)≈8.2e−4. Min-cost uses η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099, so t≈0.846 (not 0.85 by using 99, not 100); P_M≈8.0e−4 and P_FA≈0.199. For (b), to ensure P_M≤1e−4, use t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 (not 0.3), yielding P_FA≈Q(0.281)≈0.389.

      Work is terse with missing steps; an error is noted but not corrected or justified.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      Major numerical errors in MAP and min-cost thresholds; only ML and (b) values are reasonable.
  Feedback:
    Key fixes: Use the likelihood-ratio test exp(4x−8) > η ⇔ 4x−8 > ln η. Correct results: ML: decide H1 if x>2; P_M=P_FA≈0.0228. MAP (priors 0.01/0.99): x>2+(ln 99)/4≈3.149; P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost (C_FA=$1k, C_M=$10M): x>2+(ln 0.0099)/4≈0.846; P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. For (b): choose x>4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 to achieve P_M=1e−4, with P_FA≈0.389.

  Feedback:
    ML: x>2 is correct (P_M≈2.28%, P_FA≈2.28%). MAP must use 4x−8>ln(99) ⇒ x>3.149 (P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4); your 26.75 missed the ln. Min-cost must use 4x−8>ln(0.0099) ⇒ x>0.846 (P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199); your 2.002 missed the ln. You did not report miss/false-alarm rates.

      Minor approximations (99≈100; z≈-3.7) lead to small threshold deviations; otherwise arithmetic is fine.
  Feedback:
    Good derivation of thresholds: ML t=2; MAP t≈3.15; min-cost t≈0.85; and (b) t≈0.28–0.30. However, part (a) requires miss and false-alarm rates for each rule, which are missing. For completeness: ML yields P_M≈2.28%, P_FA≈2.28%; MAP yields P_M≈19.7%, P_FA≈0.082%; min-cost yields P_M≈0.08%, P_FA≈19.9%. For (b), using Φ^{-1}(1e-4)≈-3.719 gives t≈0.281; your 0.3 is a coarse approximation.

  overall=70.5, weighted=70.5
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Thresholds given for ML, MAP, and min-cost, and a threshold for (b), but no miss/false-alarm rates as requested; (b) lacks an explicit "decide H1 if x > 0.28" statement.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct use of likelihood-ratio test with priors/costs and correct quantile approach for the miss constraint.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.5
      All thresholds are correct numerically, but the required comparison of P_M and P_FA for each rule is missing.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Concise and labeled, but steps and error-probability derivations are not shown.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numerical evaluations (ln terms and inverse CDF) are accurate to acceptable precision.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds for ML (2), MAP (~3.15), and min-cost (~0.85), and the miss-constrained threshold (~0.28). To complete (a), compute and report P_M = Phi(t−4) and P_FA = Q(t) for each threshold to compare miss and false-alarm rates. For (b), explicitly state the rule: decide H1 if x > 0.28.

[0038] Q5AAAA (8).txt
  overall=43.2, weighted=43.2
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Gave ML and MAP thresholds; min-cost attempted but wrong; no miss/false-alarm rates; part (b) not completed for 0.01% miss.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.5
      Used correct LR form and ML/MAP thresholds; min-cost ratio inverted; (b) targeted 1% instead of 0.01% and did not state a clear decision rule.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Min-cost threshold incorrect; required error rates missing; (b) threshold does not meet 0.01% miss requirement.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Some steps shown, but decisions/error-rate comparisons and (b) rule not clearly presented.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Arithmetic consistent with the setup (ln(990000)≈13.8; Z≈−2.33 for 1%).
  Feedback:
    Corrections: ML: decide H1 if x>2; P_M≈0.0228, P_FA≈0.0228. MAP: x>3.149; P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost uses η=[P(H0)C_FA]/[P(H1)C_M]=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099, so t=2+ln(η)/4≈0.846; P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. For miss ≤0.01% (1e−4), set t=4+Φ^{-1}(1e−4)≈0.281 and decide H1 if x>0.281; then P_FA≈0.389.

[0039] Q5AAAA (9).txt
  overall=84.1, weighted=84.1
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      Decision thresholds are given for ML, MAP, and min-cost, and k for part (b), but miss and false-alarm rates (and their comparison) for part (a) are missing.
    - Method Accuracy: 1.0
      Correct likelihood-ratio setup and thresholds for ML, MAP, and Bayes min-cost; correct constraint handling for part (b).
    - Final Answer Correctness: 1.0
      All stated thresholds are correct (ML: 2, MAP: ~3.15, min-cost: ~0.85, part b: ~0.29).
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Work is terse but understandable; lacks explicit error-rate expressions and requested comparison.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 1.0
      Numeric values (ln 0.0099 ≈ -4.61; thresholds 0.85 and 0.29) are accurate within acceptable rounding.
  Feedback:
    Good thresholds for ML, MAP, and min-cost; part (b) threshold is appropriate. However, part (a) is incomplete: you did not compute or compare the miss (P_M) and false-alarm (P_FA) rates for each rule.

[0040] Q5AAAA (10).txt
  overall=6.8, weighted=6.8
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.0
      Miss/false-alarm rates not provided; min-cost rule not quantified; MAP part incomplete.
    - Method Accuracy: 0.0
      Wrong MAP threshold formula; no Bayes-risk threshold for min-cost; 0.01% misinterpreted as 4σ.
    - Final Answer Correctness: 0.0
      Only ML threshold (x>2) is correct; MAP threshold is wrong; min-cost threshold missing; (b) threshold 0 meets the constraint but is not the tight solution.
    - Reasoning Clarity: 0.5
      Intent is understandable but steps and justifications are sparse.
    - Calculation Accuracy: 0.0
      ln(99) used but applied incorrectly; 4σ does not correspond to 0.01%; key numeric results missing.
  Feedback:
    ML: Correct threshold x>2; corresponding P_M=P_FA≈0.0228. MAP: Use t=2+(ln(P(H0)/P(H1)))/4=2+(ln99)/4≈3.149, giving P_M≈0.197, P_FA≈8.2e−4. Min-cost: η=(0.99·1000)/(0.01·10^7)=0.0099 ⇒ t=2+(lnη)/4≈0.846; P_M≈8.0e−4, P_FA≈0.199. You needed to report these error rates. (b) To ensure P_M≤0.01% set t=4+Φ^{-1}(10^{-4})≈0.281 (decide H1 if x>t); your t=0 also satisfies the ≤ constraint but is more conservative (P_FA=0.5 vs ≈0.389 at t≈0.281).
