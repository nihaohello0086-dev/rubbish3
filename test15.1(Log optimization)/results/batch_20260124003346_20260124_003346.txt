      All parts (a)-(d) answered with expressions in p (and q=1-p).
    - Method: 1.0
      Correct binomial modeling and geometric/first-success reasoning; proper conditioning in (d).
    - Final Answer: 1.0
      All final expressions match the correct forms.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Combinatorial coefficients, exponents, and summation limits are correct.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately; no unit issues.

[0002] Q3A (2).docx
  overall=70.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (d) not provided exactly; (c) omits a required case.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup for (a),(b); (c) misses X=0 case; (d) uses an unjustified approximation.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) and (d) incorrect.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/simplification errors in provided expressions.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed appropriately.
  Feedback:
    Good on (a) and (b). For (c), include the case of no B at all: P(X≤4)=p^{40}+1−p^4. For (d), an approximation is not acceptable; the exact numerator is p^{25}q^{15}[C(39,25)+C(38,24)+C(37,23)+C(36,22)]=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)], and the denominator is p^{40}+1−p^4, so P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(p^{40}+1−p^4).

[0003] Q3A (3).docx
  overall=20.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Attempted all parts (a)-(d).
    - Method: 0.0
      Missing binomial coefficients in (a),(b); omitted X=0 in (c); wrongly assumed independence and omitted conditioning denominator in (d).
    - Final Answer: 0.0
      All parts incorrect as stated: (a) needs C(40,30)(1−p)^{30}p^{10}; (b) needs Σ_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1−p)^k p^{40−k}; (c) should be 1−p^4 + p^{40}; (d) requires P(E∩{X≤4})/P(X≤4), not a product.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/algebraic errors; issues are conceptual/modeling.
    - Unit: 1.0
      No units required.
  Feedback:
    Use the binomial coefficient for vote counts. Include the X=0 case in (c). For (d), compute P(E∩{X≤4}) and divide by P(X≤4); E and {X≤4} are not independent.

[0004] Q3A (4).docx
  overall=75.0, weighted=None
  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Answered all parts (a)–(d).
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup and complement/geometric reasoning, but omitted the X=0 case.

      (a),(b) correct. (c) should be 1 − p^4 + p^{40}. (d) denominator should be 1 − p^4 + p^{40}.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Combinatorial factors and powers are consistent; (d) numerator equals p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)].
    - Unit: 1.0
      Valid probability expressions; no unit issues.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the binomial model: (a) C(40,30)(1−p)^{30}p^{10} and (b) ∑_{k=30}^{40} C(40,k)(1−p)^k p^{40−k} are correct. For (c), include the X=0 case: P(X≤4)=1−p^4+p^{40}. For (d), your numerator is correct, but the conditioning event is X≤4, so use denominator 1−p^4+p^{40}: P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}).

    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities are unitless; no unit issues.

    Let q = 1 − p. Votes for B ~ Binomial(40, q). (a) Use C(40,30) q^30 p^10. (b) Sum from k=30 to 40: Σ C(40,k) q^k p^{40−k}. (c) X is geometric with a truncation: P(X ≤ 4) = p^{40} + q(1 + p + p^2 + p^3) = 1 − p^4 + p^{40}. (d) Condition on X ≤ 4 and count arrangements yielding 25 A’s: P(E | X ≤ 4) = p^{25} q^{15} [C(40,25) − C(36,21)] / (1 − p^4 + p^{40}).

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      All parts (a)-(d) answered.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup for (a),(b); missed X=0 case in (c); unjustified approximation in (d).
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) missing p^40 term; (d) conditional probability computed incorrectly.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic errors; issues are probabilistic setup.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed correctly (dimensionless).
  Feedback:
    (a) Correct. (b) Correct. (c) You omitted the X=0 (no B) case; P(X≤4)=p^{40} + (1-p)(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1−p^4+p^{40}. (d) Do not approximate: P(E∩{X≤4})=p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(39,25)+C(38,24)+C(37,23)+C(36,22)]=p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)], so P(E|X≤4)=p^{25}(1-p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}).

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 1.0
      Provided answers for (a)–(d) in terms of p.
    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup and conditioning, but (c) ignores the X=0 case in the complement.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      a,b correct; c should be 1 − p^4 + p^{40}; d should divide by 1 − p^4 + p^{40}.

      Combinatorial/algebraic steps (e.g., C(36,21) term) handled correctly.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Not applicable; expressions are dimensionless probabilities.
  Feedback:
    Good binomial modeling. Remember to include P(X=0)=p^{40}: P(X≤4)=1−p^4+p^{40}, and use this denominator in (d). The rest is correct.

    - Completeness: 1.0

    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct. (c) should be p^{40}+q(1+p+p^2+p^3)=1−p^4+p^{40}. (d) should be p^{25}q^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No computational/combination errors; issues are probabilistic reasoning.

    - Method: 1.0
      Correct binomial/geometric reasoning; proper conditioning in (d).
    - Final Answer: 1.0
      Expressions match the correct forms; (d) correctly simplifies to [C(40,25)−C(36,21)] p^25 (1−p)^15 / (1−p^4 + p^40).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Exponents and combinatorial coefficients are correct.
    - Unit: 1.0
      All quantities are valid probabilities.
  Feedback:

    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup for (a),(b); but (c) omits X=0 case and (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) correct; (c) should be 1 - p^4 + p^{40}; (d) needs conditional counting, not P(E)/P(X≤4).
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      Algebraic manipulations done correctly given the chosen approach.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Valid probability expressions; no unit issues.

  Rubric details:
    - Completeness: 0.5
      All parts attempted, but (c) omits the X=0 case and (d) ignores conditioning.
    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial setup correct for (a),(b); (c) misidentifies event; (d) incorrectly assumes independence.
    - Final Answer: 0.5
      (a),(b) acceptable; (c) should be 1 − p^4 + p^{40}; (d) should condition: p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}).

      No algebraic/arithmetic errors in the provided terms.
    - Unit: 1.0
      Probabilities expressed correctly without units.
  Feedback:
    Good use of the binomial model in (a) and the summation idea in (b). In (c), X ≤ 4 includes the no-B case, so add p^{40}: P(X ≤ 4) = 1 − p^4 + p^{40}. In (d), E and {X ≤ 4} are not independent; the correct conditional is p^{25}(1−p)^{15}[C(40,25)−C(36,21)]/(1−p^4+p^{40}).

    - Method: 0.5
      Correct binomial setup for (a),(b); (c) misses P(X=0); (d) uses unjustified approximation instead of conditioning/counting.

      (a),(b) correct; (c) should be 1 − p^4 + p^40; (d) incorrect—needs exact conditional expression.
    - Arithmetic: 1.0
      No arithmetic/aggregation errors; symbolic forms acceptable.

    - Method: 0.5
      Binomial setup correct in (a),(b). For (c) need cumulative/geometric sum; for (d) need conditional probability with intersection and P(X≤4).
