The statement V_BE = V_CE is acceptable here (equivalent to V_C = V_B).,1.0,Final numeric answer I_C = 1.7 mA is correct.,1.0,Arithmetic is correct (2.5−0.8 = 1.7 V; 1.7 V/1 kΩ = 1.7 mA).,1.0,Proper units used (mA).,"Correct solution and numeric result. Minor wording nit: stating the active‑limit as V_C = V_B (or V_CE = V_BE) is slightly clearer, but your usage yields the same correct answer."
0002,屏幕截图 2026-01-05 145736.png,True,30.0,,0.0,Answer does not address the given problem — it solves a different scenario (mentions Av and a 50 kΩ resistor not in the problem).,0.0,"Method is incorrect for this question. Correct approach: enforce V_C > V_B, yielding I_C < (VCC − V_BE)/R_C and choose the upper limit for maximum gain.",0.0,Final numeric answer is wrong for the given circuit; student reports ≈0.0104 mA but the correct bias current is 1.7 mA.,0.5,"Arithmetic in the student's isolated computation is internally consistent (0.0104 mA from their numbers), but those assumptions are not applicable to the problem.",1.0,"Units are used correctly (mA, V).","Your solution does not apply to the given circuit. For maximum gain while keeping Q1 active, require V_C > V_B (with V_B ≈ V_BE), so I_C < (VCC − V_BE)/R_C. Thus choose I_C = (2.5 V − 0.8 V)/1.0 kΩ = 1.7 mA. Rework using that constraint."
